Have you ever seen an old time gospel preacher?  Maybe even if just portrayed in a movie?  Big, boisterous, voice.  A tone of conviction that moves the congregation to its feet.  The choir starts signing, and people start dancing in the aisles.  Hallelujah!

> You will have to bear with me here as this post is going to carry heavy religious overtones at first.  We will get to the business of developer relations along the way.

Now imagine that preacher visiting your house for dinner.  Imagine them carrying the same voice and tone.  A few days later, you pass them in the grocery store, and again, the same boisterous voice and tone of conviction.  "Gotta, gotta, gotta, buy some BANANAS!"  At the PTA meeting, and so on.  Okay, this is starting to get old.

In many ways, the developer advocate is like a preacher.  You can sense the conviction they have about a technology.  They take the stage and give it to you straight, hoping to motivate you to action.  But just as the preacher is not constantly preaching, nor should a developer advocate.

### Getting to Know You

In Christianity, preaching is usually a part of a broader role called "pastor".  The mostly unseen work of a pastor is in helping those in the congregation in time of need (or in celebration).  Visiting the ill in hospitals.  Helping people cope with a death in the family.  Welcoming a newborn baby into the world.

> While every pastor would love for you to hear their Sunday message and be convicted enough to change your life, it is the countless hours spent in conversation with others that have the biggest impact.  So should it be with developer advocates.

Chances are that you have friends.  Some of these friends may be really close.  Maybe you have helped one through a hard time in their life.  Others may be more acquaintances that you see only at work.  Regardless of the spectrum, I am willing to bet that you could name your top ten friends.

If you looked closely at those relationships, I would further suggest that those most close and dear to you are the ones you trust the most.  If you gave them advice, they would certainly consider it, if not take action on it.

If you are in developer relations, do you know the best developers using your technology?  Do you listen to what they say?  Do you take action?  If you give them technology advice, will they take action?  Do you know the names of their kids?

### Relationships Build Trust

Wait, wait, wait!  Do not run off just yet!  I know that comes across as really creepy at first, but hear me out.  It is really only creepy if you are looking at it from a heartless, mechanical, CRM kind of perspective.  When you blur the line between your work as a developer advocate, and being a person with friends, the creepiness starts to fade.

When I go to a conference, especially ones I have been to before, I get genuinely excited.  I am going to hang out with my friends.  And I am not talking just about "birds of a feather flock together" friends, but people with whom I would go on vacation.  People with whom I would stay after the conference, and go hiking on the weekend.

To be clear, just as we have friends who are really more just acquaintances we see at work, there will be just acquaintances I see at an event.  Sometimes I am even just shaking hands and remembering that a specific developer works for a company I want to get access to.  Sometimes it is just CRM-worthy business.  I always go into an event however with the mentality of making friends.  Relationships build trust, and only then can we move the industry forward.
