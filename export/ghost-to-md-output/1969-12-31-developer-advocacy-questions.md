Ashley McNamara recently published her thoughts around "[What is Developer Advocacy?](https://medium.com/@ashleymcnamara/what-is-developer-advocacy-3a92442b627c)" Having worked in the developer relations space for over a decade, I always enjoy reading the perspective of others. How companies approach developer relations is often reflective of their internal cultures, which is probably more telling than they would like.

Perhaps what I enjoyed even more were the questions that came after the article. There were a few of them where I really wanted to join the conversation, but I had a hard time keeping the content concise. Instead, I figured I would just tackle them here, as the next installment of my series on developer relations ...

#### More Than Getting Started

[Chen Shou](https://medium.com/@shou3301) was wondering why so many advocates seem to be focused on getting started demonstrations.

A lot could be said here about the pace of technology, or what kind of content most conferences accept, but I like to think of this as a matter of personality.

I had a sociology professor in college that stated something along the lines of "humans tend to chase bright, shiny objects". I do not even remember the context of the lecture, but that phrase has stuck with me, mostly because it very much defines one of my key personality traits (smile). If I am not kicking the tires on a new technology, I am not happy. I care a lot less about how to scale something, than taking it apart and figuring out what makes it tick in the first place - and my career has echoed this trait from consulting projects to proof-of-concept work in technical sales.

Imagine my surprise then when I discovered that many developers are very passionate about getting the implementation exactly right! Gasp!

Within the context of developer relations, I break these personality traits down into the "art of the possible" and the "reality of production".

**Art of the Possible**

- Describes new and potential technology scenarios
- Focuses on the cool, new, and bleeding edge
- Helps developers visualize the potential

**Reality of Production**

- Describes solving real problems with new technology
- Focused helping in production
- Help developer bridge the gap between demo and production

> I should point out that my thoughts around personality traits is inspired by "[Making the Technical Sale](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Technical-Sale-Successful-Consultant/dp/B01FKU4YG0)" which goes into some length about matching your personality with how you approach the technical sale.

**Corporate Culture**

While being self-aware, and working in a manner that best suits your personality are important, I think there is something deeper happening in the current context of developer relations - we are watering it down.

An evangelist is one who seeks to convert others [to the Christian faith]. At the end of the day, this is very much what most companies want from developer relations - to convert you to their technology (faith). In order to convert somebody, you must first introduce them to the concept. Translated into conference sessions - getting started.

*This is a corporate culture tell.*

If you see most presentations from a specific company focused on "getting started" then what they are telling you is that they view themselves at the "innovation trigger" stage of the Gartner Hype Cycle, and pushing up the "peak of inflated expectations". It also tells you that the company likely does not want to build community, or have a relationship with the developers that use its technology.
