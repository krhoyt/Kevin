It has been a number of years since I have been involved in running a conference. When a chance to chair a track around future technology at Index, I jumped at the opportunity. Beyond just my track however, here are some of the exciting sessions that I am looking to attend.

#### Index?

[Index](http://indexconf.com) is a developer conference in San Fransisco, CA on February 20 - 22, 2018. While it is being largely organized by IBM, Index is run almost entirely by industry leaders from Amazon, Nexmo (Vonage), Teradata, GoDaddy, and others. Index consists of eight different tracks from AI to Web, and containers to blockchain.

If you are a developer in the Bay Area, it is easy access to some of amazing speakers - a great chance to bolster existing skills, and check out new ones.

Here are some of the session I am most looking forward to seeing ...

##### Node.js: What's Next

**What:** New features, major changes, and key initiatives, oh my!

**Why:**[Michael Dawson](https://twitter.com/mhdawson1) is the chair of the technical steering committee for Node.js. Few are closer what would be next with Node.js than Michael.

##### Easy, Component-based, Serverless Applications with JavaScript

**What:** A closer look at [Architect](https://arc.codes), a CLI for serverless deployments, and [Marko](https://markojs.com), a component UI library from the JS Foundation.

**Why:**[Kris Borchers](https://twitter.com/kborchers) is the Executive Director of the [JS Foundation](https://js.foundation/) - keepers of projects like Grunt, Mocha, Webpack, and so much more.

##### Moving 75,000 Microsofties to DevOps on the Public Cloud

**What:** From culture to code, this is the story of how you take an entire organization to the cloud, from ... one of the main cloud vendors, Microsoft.

**Why:**[Sam Guckenheimer](https://twitter.com/SamGuckenheimer) is the Product Owner of Visual Studio Team Services, at Microsoft, will be giving a first-hand account of the process.

##### Tensorflow, deep learning and modern RNN architectures, without a PhD

**What:** Learning TensorFlow without the PhD. Enough said.

**Why:** TensorFlow comes out of Google, and while they have not yet moved to open governance, the best place to learn more is from Google themselves - in this case, [Martin Gorner](https://twitter.com/martin_gorner), from the Google Developer Relations team.

##### Getting out of the bubble with global developer communities

**What:** All about planning and executing on a global developer relations tour, including coverage of those regions where you may not know your developers quite as well.

**Why:** I have been in developer relations for over a decade now, and I always love hearing stories of how others approach the space. In this case, [Bear Douglas](https://twitter.com/beardigsit) from Slack.

##### Discover how to include natural language generation in your applications

**What:** You may have heard of Natural Language Processing (NLP) - taking raw text, and getting data about the content. Natural Language Generation is the opposite - taking data about something and generating raw, cohesive, text. A Chief Scientist from [Arria](https://www.arria.com) - the leader in this space - will be presenting.

**Why:** I had a project recently in the finance vertical where we took financial data, and made what was effectively a customer prospectus, using NLG. The world has no shortage of data, but communicating it effectively is becoming a real challenge.

##### Controlling a Quantum Computer with Code

**What:** Quantum computers are a thing, but the tooling to take advantage of them is ... well ... not. This session by Rigetti Software Engineer, [Steven Heidel](https://twitter.com/stevenheidel) lets us know where they need help.

**Why:** As an IBMer, I am somewhat familiar with the concept of quantum computing - at least what we are doing in the space. It will be interesting to see what the competition is up to.

#### Next Steps

Register for [Index](http://indexconf.com), duh! Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft, and so many more, all pushing the boundaries of development. You would be hard pressed to get this amount of technical depth and diversity in a single conference, anywhere.
