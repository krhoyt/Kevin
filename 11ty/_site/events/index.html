<em>March 6 - 8, 2019</em></p>
<p><strong>Session:</strong> <a href="https://devnexus.com/presentations/3150">Computer Vision vs. Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Set against the backdrop of the capabilities of the browser, this interactive session compares and contrasts both approaches through two different applications. In the first, you will learn image processing and feature detection techniques to track, and solve, a Rubik’s Cube. In the second, you will learn to apply those techniques to build an object classifier for facial recognition. Sit in the front row at your own risk!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://careerlink.com/hdc">Heartland Developer Conference 2018</a></strong><br>
<em>September 5 - 7, 2018</em></p>
<p><strong>Workshop:</strong> <a href="http://sched.co/FEvn">Computer Vision and Machine Learning in the Browser</a></p>
<p>The browser, on both the desktop and mobile, are capable of much more than we often give them credit. In this workshop we will push the CPU to 100% as we audit several image processing libraries used for computer vision and machine learning.</p>
<p>Learn computer vision with real-time facial detection, optical character recognition, color distance calculations, object tracking, and even reading barcodes and augmented reality markers. From there, we will turn our focus to machine learning where you will learn about developing models for neural networks.</p>
<p><strong>Session:</strong> <a href="http://sched.co/FEzB">Computer Vision vs. Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Computer vision seeks to acquire, process, and analyze digital images based on dimensional data to produce numerical decisions. Machine learning applies convolutional neural networks to classify, identify, and detect symbolic information from image data. The easiest way to decipher all of this and understand when to apply which technique to your application, is to attend this session.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://indexconf.com">Index Conference 2018</a></strong><br>
<em>February 20 - 22, 2018</em></p>
<p><strong>Track Manager:</strong> Geek Shop and the Future</p>
<p>In the fall of 2017, I was asked to manage a track centered around future technology for a new conference, Index. I had managed the web standards track at Adobe MAX years ago, and thoroughly enjoyed the collaboration. These days I tend to be more focused on emerging technology, so Index seemed like a great fit.</p>
<p>At first, as a passionate practitioner of desktop fabrication, and the maker movement, I really wanted to focus on the &quot;geek shop&quot; side of things. Most of the makers in my professional network were busy however, and the submitted abstracts pushed the track into the &quot;futures&quot; topic. Coverage included quantum computing, blockchain, augmented reality, and even &quot;wetware&quot; - the physical integration of man and machine.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://careerlink.com/hdc/">Heartland Developer Conference 2017</a></strong><br>
<em>September 6 - 8, 2017</em></p>
<p><strong>Workshop:</strong> <a href="http://sched.co/B98S">Understanding Blockchain</a></p>
<p>The cryptocurrency Bitcoin is well known even outside of technology spheres of influence. Underlying Bitcoin however is Blockchain - a distributed ledger with some very special properties. These properties make Blockchain an ideal data store for all variety of applications, not just financial records. This workshop, half lecture and half interactive hands-on, is designed to help you understand blockchain, and how to use it in your business.</p>
<p>Lecture topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where does blockchain fit in your application infrastructure?</li>
<li>What are the differences between ledgers and databases?</li>
<li>How does chaining data work, and why does it matter?</li>
<li>What is decentralized consensus, and why does it matter?</li>
<li>What patterns identify an application as a fit for blockchain?</li>
<li>What are smart contracts, and how are they developed?</li>
</ul>
<p>Hands-on activities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model the business domain of a blockchain application</li>
<li>Write transaction functions using JavaScript</li>
<li>Test a blockchain application</li>
<li>Interact with blockchain via REST</li>
<li>Trade physical assets with other attendees via blockchain</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Session:</strong> <a href="http://sched.co/B9DA">Indoor Location with Beacons</a></p>
<p>Having a highly capable and accurate GPS in everybody's pocket has fundamentally changed the way we live, with broader impacts like self-driving cars, yet to come. The moment you step inside the HDC conference center however, all that technology is virtually useless. In order to solve this problem, various vendors, from Apple to Google, and many others, have been implementing indoor location technologies, predominantly via beacons.</p>
<p>In this session learn how beacons function at the physical layer, how that gets interpreted at the network layer, how to use the APIs at the presentation layer, and how to make sense of it all at the application layer. This will be accomplished as IBM Developer Advocate, Kevin Hoyt, configures and deploys a set of beacons in the conference room, live, during the session. We will also explore how various industries are using indoor location from shopping malls to hotels, and airports to grocery stores.</p>

<p><strong>Keynote:</strong> <a href="https://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/talks.jsp#CrossingtheIoTChasm">Crossing the IoT Chasm</a></p>
<p>I gave my first IoT presentation over a decade ago. The response was overwhelming, and I've been waiting for the IoT tidal wave to land ever since. Strangely, it has not. Why not? Fast-forward through those ten years, and I have learned countless lessons. Join me as I review the strengths and weakness of hardware platforms designed to get you to market, examine how Big Data may just hold the key to IoT success, and glimpse at an AI-powered future.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://oct2016.desertcodecamp.com/">Desert Code Camp 2016</a></strong><br>
<em>October 8, 2016</em></p>
<p><strong>Session:</strong> <a href="http://oct2016.desertcodecamp.com/session/1313">Explore Machine Learning with IBM Watson</a></p>
<p>It has been suggested that in the future, developers will not program computers, as much as train them. This has largely to do with the rapid growth of machine learning. But what is machine learning? What can it do for developers today? And how does one leverage it in their application?</p>
<p>In this session, join IBM Developer Advocate, Kevin Hoyt, and IBM Watson, to untangle the details. We will start with a little artificial intelligence history. From there we will move on to defining some of the more common machine learning features by implementing them in various applications (Node.js, iOS, JavaScript).</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://careerlink.com/hdc/">Heartland Developer Conference 2016</a></strong><br>
<em>September 7 - 9, 2016</em></p>
<p><strong>Session:</strong> Node-RED for Faster Development</p>
<p>If you have been programming long enough, you know that certain patterns emerge, and that work often gets wrapped in boilerplate code. An example would be CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on a database, that you might expose via an API. Sending an email or text message. What if you could develop, design, and orchestrate business logic using visual tooling?</p>
<p>Node-RED is an open source visual tool for wiring together business logic, built on Node.js. Expose API endpoints via drag-and-drop. Consume APIs in the same way. Access databases, email server, Watson cognitive services, Twitter feeds, and more in a browser-based tool that allows you to visual control the flow of logic. IBM Developer Advocate, Kevin Hoyt, takes you on a tour of the tool that may just revolutionize how you work, with increased productivity, and faster time to market.</p>
<p><strong>Workshop:</strong> <a href="http://careerlink.com/hdc/master-schedule">Introduction to Deep Learning with IBM Watson</a></p>
<p>What is the price of not knowing? Every day we generate 2.5 quintillion bytes of data, and 90% of the data in the world has been generated in the past two years alone. There are 7.3 billion people connected to the Internet around the world, creating 1.7 megabytes of data every minute. Unstructured data - dark data - accounts for 80% of all data generated today. Like dark matter, which cannot be seen, we know dark data exists by its impact (or lack thereof) on our industries.</p>
<p>This is the dawn of the cognitive era - an inflection point that occurs once about every 40 years - that lends itself to machine learning. In this workshop, join IBM Developer Advocate, Kevin Hoyt, and go hands on with IBM Watson. Learn about APIs such as text-to-speech, and speech-to-text, translation, image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), concept and personality insights, and more. Leave with a new toolkit to help you leverage deep learning, and to solve the problems your industry faces.</p>
