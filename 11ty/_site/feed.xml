      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is part of a series:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing Tech: &lt;a href=&quot;https://kevinhoyt.com/blog/2026/01/12/managing-people/&quot;&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing Tech: &lt;a href=&quot;https://kevinhoyt.com/blog/2026/01/14/managing-heroes/&quot;&gt;Heroes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing Tech: Professionals (you are here)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kevinhoyt.com/blog/2026/01/12/managing-people/&quot;&gt;Managing Tech: People&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned that the social contract between employee and employer has changed over the past several decades. At IBM in 2016 (just one decade ago), it was common to encounter people who had been with the company for twenty years or more. I myself spent almost fifteen years at Adobe (2000–2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2026, it is far more common to move between employers every few years. The reasons for this are many. The question then becomes: if the old contract is no longer relevant, what is the new contract?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Professionals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I start working with a new direct report, I generally tell them something along the following lines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are an adult. You are a professional. I expect adult, professional behavior from you. You can work whatever hours you want, in whatever manner you want, within reason. You know best how you get work done. Do that. I trust you to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the contract I am proposing: &lt;strong&gt;you are a professional&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oxford Dictionary defines &amp;quot;professional&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;doing something as a paid job rather than as a hobby.&amp;quot; That definition is a baseline. What matters more to me is the implied trust, accountability, and autonomy that come with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are clarifications that surface along the way, of course. For example, attending meetings during normal business hours is expected. To me, that still falls under the umbrella of professional behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Manage Your Business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this message is clear, I push the boundaries a little further with an explanation along the following lines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your job is your Business (capital “B”), and you are responsible for it. We all love to focus on product, but sometimes we are called into other business functions. Some days you may be in sales (communicating vertically about your performance). Some days it is marketing (communicating horizontally to ensure people know what you can do). If you don’t know how to do some of these, let me know, and I will mentor you through those skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an employee, I generally think of their business functions as (in no particular order):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product:&lt;/strong&gt; Deliverables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sales:&lt;/strong&gt; Vertical communication (share your awesome)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marketing:&lt;/strong&gt; Horizontal communication (find other ways to contribute)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finance:&lt;/strong&gt; Expenses; ordering gear or equipment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Resources:&lt;/strong&gt; Annual training and continuing education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer Success:&lt;/strong&gt; Meetings (stakeholders, managers, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IT:&lt;/strong&gt; Automating workflows and reporting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership:&lt;/strong&gt; Time management and mentoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot come in and just write code. To be successful, you must think about your business holistically. Touching all of these functions ensures that your business - and your career - runs smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For The Manager&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This contract is not just for the direct report - it applies equally to the manager. You must hold yourself to the same standard. Failing to do so erodes trust, and once trust is gone, the contract no longer works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to take this one step further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not ask a direct report to do something that you have not done in the past, or are not willing to do in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tech, this idea can feel counterintuitive. Innovation never stops, and you may ask someone to deliver a feature you have never personally built. But this principle is not about that specific feature - it is about the nature of the work. You understand what delivery entails: the extra hours when needed, the on-call rotation, the pressure of deadlines, and the responsibility that comes with ownership. That shared understanding matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an employee has a family emergency, are you willing to step in, roll up your sleeves, and write some code? If someone is struggling with part of a feature, are you willing to schedule time, open the code, and work through it together - even if your role is simply to be a second set of eyes or a sounding board?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are asking a direct report to grow, stretch, or take on responsibility, you must be willing to do that work alongside them. That means using your experience to help define manageable goals, checking in on progress, and coaching - not delegating and disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new contract with employees does not absolve you from the work. It raises the bar for how you show up as a manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Professional Contract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is often a new perspective for employees, but one that is both empowering and rooted in trust. I try to regularly schedule time to coach people through these ideas. By laying out the contract in terms of familiar business functions, we establish a shared framework - and a shared understanding - of what it truly means to be a professional in today’s world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is part of a series:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing Tech: &lt;a href=&quot;https://kevinhoyt.com/blog/2026/01/12/managing-people/&quot;&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing Tech: Heroes (you are here)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing Tech: &lt;a href=&quot;https://kevinhoyt.com/blog/2026/01/16/managing-professionals/&quot;&gt;Professionals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard the term &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;elevator pitch&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;? You usually hear it in the context of pitching an idea to senior management or to investors. The idea is that the pitch for your idea or business should take no longer than an elevator ride - because that is all the time you might get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One morning, I happened to be sharing an elevator ride with a vice president at the company. It was just the two of us. He asked, &amp;quot;What is your team up to these days?&amp;quot; Feeling witty, I responded, &amp;quot;Making heroes.&amp;quot; A few days later, I heard the VP use that same phrase on a conference call - in a completely different way than I had intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that point on, I always made sure to finish the phrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Heroes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my last post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kevinhoyt.com/blog/2026/01/12/managing-people/&quot;&gt;Managing Tech: People&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned that people bring their own desires and goals to work. As a manager, you should make it a priority to understand what those desires and goals are for your employees - &lt;strong&gt;to make people heroes for what it is that they want to achieve.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is awkward at first. You will get the standard &amp;quot;Where do you want to be in five years?&amp;quot; type of dialogue. The kind of dialogue that carries hints of fear and reservation. A dialogue that is truthful, but not honest. That is a fine place to start, but you want to go deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are treating your employees like people - and you are listening closely (not just hearing) - you will begin to pick up on more honest feedback over time. As trust builds, that dialogue can become particularly transparent. More on that in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the feedback is easy to address. Something along the lines of: &amp;quot;I want to learn a new skill.&amp;quot; Great! Now you have a place to start - from which you can work backward. If the objective is X, what are the steps needed to get there? Think those through and discuss them with your employee. Work together to design and define goals. Check in on progress. Check them off. And celebrate those completions together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I generally like to have one to three goals like this set up for each employee at all times. Some may be achievable in the short term, while others may take longer. Pin goals to a year or less to best align with performance reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Radical Transparency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the feedback is surprising. If you have truly built trust - or if the employee is just that bold - you might hear something like: &amp;quot;I do not want to work in this department.&amp;quot; I have heard, &amp;quot;I don’t want to work for this company.&amp;quot; I have even heard, &amp;quot;I don’t want to work on your team.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are making heroes, perhaps these are antiheroes - heroes all the same, just unconventional.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually a breakthrough win. If you reach this level of dialogue, you should feel good about what you have accomplished as a manager. If an employee does not want to be part of the team, department, or company, you want to know. You do not want that sentiment lingering in the background, quietly poisoning the team, the project, or the culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You still want to make them heroes for what they want to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase &amp;quot;I do not want to work for this company&amp;quot; is really shorthand for &amp;quot;I want to work for a different company.&amp;quot; My response to that sentiment often surprises people. I will follow it with: &amp;quot;Where do you want to work?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;What role would you like to have there?&amp;quot; Make that a goal and work backward to plan the steps to get there. I may even have contacts at that company I can introduce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I do not want to work in this department&amp;quot; strikes me the same way, but it is often easier to address. You already know how to network within your own company - and that is usually far easier than doing so externally. In these situations, I have reached out to managers in other departments and set up mentoring conversations for the employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This helps both the employee and me understand what steps need to be taken. Maybe there are skills to develop. Certifications to earn. Or maybe everything is a perfect fit and we are simply waiting for a position to open. In some cases, I have even coordinated work between the employee and the manager in their target department. The manager gets extra help, the employee sees a real path forward, and I alleviate potential toxicity on my own team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Still People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helping employees define goals that will make them heroes - and collaborating with them to get there - can start to feel mechanical if you are not careful. You have to remember that your employees are still people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once had an employee tell me they wanted to swim to Alcatraz (Sharkfest). What an interesting personal goal. I did not make this a corporate objective, but I did follow up on their progress from time to time. When they fell behind in training, I encouraged them to stay the course. When they hit milestones, I congratulated them. When they signed up and were ready for the swim, I booked a flight to San Francisco to cheer them on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Careful of the &amp;quot;friend zone&amp;quot; I showed up, watched the event, took a picture with the employee when they finished, and then went on my way - letting them celebrate with their support team and friends who had helped them along the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stay on Target&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think that helping an employee leave the company is misaligned with company goals - but it often is not. In the technology sector, it is commonly estimated that an employee departure costs a company around $100k. More importantly, disengaged employees cost far more while they stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you come alongside an employee - when you listen, build trust, and help them become a hero for what they want to achieve - you reduce that hidden cost. Sometimes the result is growth within the team. Sometimes it is a move to another department. And sometimes it is a well-supported exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not a failure of management. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing tech is not about extracting maximum output from people. It is about creating the conditions where people can do meaningful work, grow honestly, and move forward with clarity - even when that path eventually leads away from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you make people heroes for what it is that they want to achieve, the business outcomes tend to take care of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is part of a series:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing Tech: People (you are here)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing Tech: &lt;a href=&quot;https://kevinhoyt.com/blog/2026/01/14/managing-heroes/&quot;&gt;Heroes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing Tech: &lt;a href=&quot;https://kevinhoyt.com/blog/2026/01/16/managing-professionals/&quot;&gt;Professionals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are good at your job. You come into work, consistently deliver results, and keep learning more about the business and your craft. Eventually, your abilities are noticed and you are promoted to manager. Congratulations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is just one problem: the skills that made you successful as an individual contributor (IC) no longer serve you as a manager. You struggle for a while, then eventually decide to return to your previous role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no shame in that. I have seen this happen time and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day, I was talking to a friend who had gone through this exact process. After years of being comfortably back in his IC role, he is once again being formally nudged toward management. Knowing that I have managed technical teams for nearly 20 years, he asked me for some advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a deep breath, sat with the question for a moment, and suggested...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to managing people - especially in tech - my first thought is simple: remember that your employees are people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds obvious, but tech cultures are often tuned to extract as much value from employees as possible. If you are not careful, those employees can start to look like cogs. Cogs are replaceable when they stop working. People are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every employee brings a full life with them to work every day: desires, goals, problems, stresses, emotions - everything from the journey that led them to this role. When you interact with your employees, interact with them as people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have a 1:1, ask, &amp;quot;How are you?&amp;quot; Mean it. Listen - not just hear - the response. Ask follow-up questions. Try to understand their perspective in that moment. What is motivating them? What is weighing on them? Is there anything you need to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the answer is no. Most of the time, it is. But if you listen closely enough, you will occasionally find moments where you can change the trajectory of an employee’s work—and sometimes their experience at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Free Pass&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking this is ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You pay these people to show up and do a job. What happens outside of work is n0t your concern. Just deliver. Deal with your baggage on your own time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with this mindset is that humans are social animals. Even introverts - even the shy - need social interaction (just the right kind). By ignoring who your employees are as people, you are ignoring the very interactions that shape who they are at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The social contract between employee and employer has changed dramatically over the past several decades - especially in tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are 24 hours in a day and an employee works an eight-hour shift, that leaves 16 other hours influencing how they show up. Ignoring that reality means ignoring roughly 66% of what makes your employee your employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you ignore 66% of your business?&lt;br /&gt;
Would you leave 66% of your revenue on the table?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a free pass. It is compassion. It is empathy for another human being. It is not a &amp;quot;get out of jail free&amp;quot; card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a manager, you still need results. Deadlines still exist. The company is looking to you to deliver. Treating employees as people does not change that - it gives you a better way to lead through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an employee wakes up with a flat tire and arrives late, the key question is not &amp;quot;Why are you late?&amp;quot; It is &amp;quot;Will this impact deliverables?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it will, how can you reallocate resources to keep things on track? Maybe another employee has been looking for a chance to stretch. Maybe someone else wants exposure to a different project. You can only make those decisions if you understand your people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now think about the employee with the flat tire. It is stressful. It is frustrating. You would probably appreciate a little flexibility to fix the problem and move on. Offer that time. Let them resolve the issue quickly so they can return focused and productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what you actually want: problems resolved in a way that still allows the team to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A welcome side effect of this approach is trust. Trust leads to loyalty - to you, to the team, and sometimes to the company. And the next time someone else needs help, that employee is far more likely to pay it forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Word of Caution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treating employees as people is critical - but remember that you are still the manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will write performance reviews. You will adjust compensation. You may have to let someone go. There may be reorganizations that move people across teams. If you get too close, these moments can create real legal and organizational risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not their friend. You are their manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empathy and humanity will help you lead through change, but crossing fully into the &amp;quot;friend zone&amp;quot; should be avoided. You do not need to enforce hierarchy - but you do need to maintain a healthy, professional distance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Web Components get a bad rap. They are often described as too long, too verbose, or burdened with boilerplate. I recently had ChatGPT migrate the “label” component from the previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://kevinhoyt.com/blog/2026/01/05/label-component/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; to React. The result was less readable and nearly twice as long. Between recurring React security issues and the latest &amp;quot;Tailwind is dead&amp;quot; discourse, the ecosystem feels noisier than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are a number of different ways to leverage the various standards that make up Web Components, I like a Shadow DOM implementation that leans on composability wherever possible - especially via slots, parts, and predictable APIs. My component template is pretty dialed in. I have built hundreds of components this way, and it is the approach I keep coming back to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have implemented applications with Light DOM as well, and never quite developed a workflow I liked. Perhaps as somebody that has built applications with technologies like Java Swing and Visual Basic, the Shadow DOM approach just resonates more with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Top and Bottom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening line of the template extends the &lt;code&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/code&gt; class. This is standard for Web Components. For the name of the subclass, I like to use the prefix I intend to use for the component, followed by a name that describes the component. For example, a button component with the &lt;code&gt;kh-&lt;/code&gt; prefix would become &lt;code&gt;KhButton&lt;/code&gt;. In this post, we will use &lt;code&gt;KhTemplate&lt;/code&gt; as a generic example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;KhTemplate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;customElements&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;kh-template&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; KhTemplate &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last line of the template wires up the subclass to the element name. The prefix must be present. The most common prefix is generally two or three letters, but I have seen complete words, and even multiple words used as a prefix (for example &lt;code&gt;solar-system-sun&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;solar-system-earth&lt;/code&gt;). My guidance would be to use whatever makes resulting code most readable. Consistency is key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Constructor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the constructor defines the styles and markup that make up the component. I generally include a &lt;code&gt;:host&lt;/code&gt; CSS block that contains at least &lt;code&gt;box-sizing: border-box&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;display: inline-block&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;position: relative&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;box-sizing&lt;/code&gt; model helps make the layout more predictable. The &lt;code&gt;display&lt;/code&gt; can be whatever you need, I prefer to specify it for consistency and maintainability. The relative &lt;code&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; comes in handy when you need to absolutely position something inside the component like a tooltip or &lt;code&gt;::after&lt;/code&gt; content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; template &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;template&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  template&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;innerHTML &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* template */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;
    &amp;lt;style&gt;
      :host {
        box-sizing: border-box;
        display: inline-block;
        position: relative;
      }
    &amp;lt;/style&gt;
    &amp;lt;p part=&quot;label&quot;&gt;Hello world!&amp;lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like to include the &lt;code&gt;part&lt;/code&gt; attribute whenever I think the element may need to be styled by the developer. I find that if I am reaching for &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; to be able to reference the element, then I should probably just use a &lt;code&gt;part&lt;/code&gt; name. This makes the part stylable, and easy to reference with &lt;code&gt;querySelector()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the constructor is declaring everything the component needs. I start with properties, and have specific default values I like to use. I also use the underscore (&lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;) character to denote that these are &amp;quot;private&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Properties&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;_anArray &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;_aDate &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;_anObject &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Events&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;onComponentClick &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onComponentClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Root&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;attachShadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;open&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;shadowRoot&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; template&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;content&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;cloneNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Elements&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;$label &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;shadowRoot&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;p[part=label]&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most components handle some form of events internally. Here is where we declare those events. I use &lt;code&gt;bind()&lt;/code&gt; so that they are also easily removed. Events get wired up later in the &lt;code&gt;connectedCallback()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we stamp out the template by attaching it to the component’s &lt;code&gt;shadowRoot&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, any element references you will need during the life of the component. I like to use &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; to indicate that this property refers to an element. This allows me to have a property &lt;code&gt;this._label&lt;/code&gt; align with an element &lt;code&gt;this.$label&lt;/code&gt; to make things more readable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Event Handlers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the constructor, I will define any of the events I referenced inside the constructor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onComponentClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;evt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;dispatchEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;CustomEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;kh-event&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;bubbles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;cancelable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;composed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;detail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token string-property property&quot;&gt;&#39;abc&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;123&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not generally like to rely on bubbling - either of native events or events that my components dispatch. If there is a &lt;code&gt;button&lt;/code&gt; element inside my component, I will attach a click handler inside the component and in turn have the component dispatch something more relevant - even if it is just an &lt;code&gt;kh-click&lt;/code&gt;. Whenever I use my components then, I always listen for the component specific event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to think that this makes the event handling easier to follow, and that it avoids any collision with other components I may be using (especially in a composable manner). In practice, I have never encountered any problems getting the right event from the right component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rendering Content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;_render()&lt;/code&gt; method is where I update the elements within the component based on changes to attributes or properties. If the changes come from attribute changes, I will reference those access methods directly. If the changes are coming from property changes, then I will reference the internal property such as &lt;code&gt;this._value&lt;/code&gt; directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never set an attribute or property of the component itself from inside the &lt;code&gt;_render()&lt;/code&gt; method. This will result in an infinite loop.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// When attributes change&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;_render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;$label&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;textContent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;aString &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;aString&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of something like a calendar component, where there are ~50 elements inside the component, this method definition can get pretty lengthy. Think of this as working with a scalpel, not a virtual DOM. You can set the &lt;code&gt;textContent&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;this.$label&lt;/code&gt; instance repeatedly without a performance impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Upgrade&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on how your component is used, property values may be assigned before the component has had a chance to initialize. If this happens, any property values that were assigned will become &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;. To get around this, as part of the initialization, I leverage a method named &lt;code&gt;_upgrade()&lt;/code&gt;. We will see this more in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Promote properties&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Values may be set before module load&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;_upgrade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;hasOwnProperty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; property &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; value &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;property&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;delete&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;property&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;property&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;_upgrade()&lt;/code&gt; method checks for the existence of a property value. If it exists, that property is referenced to a local value. The property value itself is then deleted, and then immediately set with the local value. This ensures that any properties assigned before upgrade are properly re-applied once the component is fully initialized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Connect and Disconnect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a component is attached to the DOM, it calls the &lt;code&gt;connectedCallback()&lt;/code&gt; method. This is where you can wire up your events, and perform an initial render. When the component is removed from the DOM, it calls the &lt;code&gt;disconnectedCallback()&lt;/code&gt; method. This is where you want to remove any event handlers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Setup&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;connectedCallback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;$label&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;click&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;onComponentClick &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;_upgrade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;anArray&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;      
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;_upgrade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;aBoolean&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;_upgrade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;aDate&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;_upgrade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;aFloat&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;      
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;_upgrade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;anInteger&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;            
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;_upgrade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;anObject&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;_upgrade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;aString&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;_render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Set down&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;disconnectedCallback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;$label&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;removeEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;click&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;onComponentClick &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is where the &lt;code&gt;_upgrade()&lt;/code&gt; method shows up. You should apply the upgrade to all attribute and property values that are exposed externally. Now that we are sure the state of the component is what the developer expected, we can call &lt;code&gt;_render()&lt;/code&gt; to place all the values in the component DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Attributes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are almost done implementing our web component. We have attributes and properties remaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;observedAttributes()&lt;/code&gt; method is part of the specification that tells the component what attributes might change at runtime. This means that if you set a &lt;code&gt;data-id&lt;/code&gt; attribute on the element at runtime, and the &lt;code&gt;data-id&lt;/code&gt; attribute is not declared in &lt;code&gt;observedAttributes()&lt;/code&gt;, then no updates will happen to the component - the attribute is not registered - and that may be what is desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;label&amp;quot; component on the other hand will likely have a &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; attribute. We expect the internal DOM of the component to be updated when that attribute is added, changed, or removed. For this change to happen, we need to tell the component about the attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not need to list properties here - they are handled directly via their setters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Watched attributes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;observedAttributes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;a-boolean&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;a-float&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;an-integer&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;a-string&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Observed attribute has changed&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Update render&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;attributeChangedCallback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; old&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;_render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an attribute is changed, the &lt;code&gt;_render()&lt;/code&gt; method is called to update the DOM. This may look different than some other component implementations you may have seen. This is because in this implementation, some property changes may change the DOM as well. Rather than have that code in multiple places, it gets centralized in the &lt;code&gt;_render()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Properties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically attributes can only be strings. We will add some syntactic sugar in a moment to be able to handle basic types such as integers, floats, and booleans. There are times however when you really need to pass an object to the component. That is where properties come into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have specific signatures I like to use for my properties. I will declare them in the constructor with a default value, and assign them there for any runtime changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Properties&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Not reflected&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Array, Date, Object, null&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;anArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;_anArray&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;_anArray&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;anArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;_anArray &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; value &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;aDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;_aDate&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;aDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;anObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;_anObject&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;anObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;_anObject &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; value &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;structuredClone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; value &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Properties are defined using access methods. When working with them at runtime, they take on the same look at when working with attributes (&lt;code&gt;label.text = &#39;Hello world.&#39;&lt;/code&gt;). Regardless of properties or attributes, I force the default to &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; for consistency (with the exception of boolean attributes). I also assign by value, and return by reference by convention across all of my components. These conventions keep everything consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to keep the consistency for attributes, and in order to add that syntactic sugar to handle specific data types, we also implement access methods for attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Attributes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Reflected&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Boolean, Float, Integer, String, null&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;aBoolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;hasAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;a-boolean&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;aBoolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; value &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      value &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These attribute access methods handle the updates to the attributes themselves (a technique commonly called &amp;quot;attribute reflection&amp;quot;). When the attribute access methods are invoked, they will in turn trigger the &lt;code&gt;attributeChangedCallback()&lt;/code&gt; method, which will in turn call the &lt;code&gt;_render()&lt;/code&gt; function to update the internal DOM as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the naming convention used in these code snippets is designed to indicate a specific data type. You will want to update/use these snippets to map to your specific API surface. For example, if you have &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; attribute, then you would implement the &lt;code&gt;aString()&lt;/code&gt; access methods, but name the methods &lt;code&gt;text()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I have implemented hundreds of components using this approach, and deployed them in production applications such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://annoawesome.com/&quot;&gt;Anno Awesome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://flavorawesome.com/&quot;&gt;Flavor Awesome&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>The Unsung UI Control: Label</title>

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Whenever I start designing a new UI, inevitably, one of the first components I create is a &lt;code&gt;Label&lt;/code&gt; component. You might think that the &lt;code&gt;Label&lt;/code&gt; is unnecessary because that is what the paragraph element (&lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;) does. And you would be partly correct. But then you have likely seen an &lt;code&gt;Input&lt;/code&gt; element or a &lt;code&gt;Checkbox&lt;/code&gt; element, and those are HTML native types as well (&lt;code&gt;input type=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;input type=&amp;quot;checkbox&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;). Same with &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt;,  &lt;code&gt;TextArea&lt;/code&gt;, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think about wrapper components like &lt;code&gt;Input&lt;/code&gt;, at a minimum they are adding functionality. In many cases component wrappers around native HTML elements will also be enforcing styling to the design system itself. With that in mind, let us take a look at how I approach building a &lt;code&gt;Label&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only design system I have seen do this implicitly is &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudscape.design/&quot;&gt;Amazon Cloudscape&lt;/a&gt; with it&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudscape.design/components/box/&quot;&gt;Box&lt;/a&gt; component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Foundations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Web Components have gotten a bad rap for being especially verbose and/or complex. This can certainly be true when you have data binding in frameworks such as Svelte, but you still need the basics in both - the CSS and the root element. From there it is a matter of extending the &lt;code&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/code&gt; class, and attaching the template to the DOM of the element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Shadow DOM approach. The alternative Light DOM approach also needs the root element and the CSS, though they will appear in different places. This is not an article about which is better. Context is key. For this example however, I will be focused on the Shadow DOM approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;HoytLabel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; template &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;template&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    template&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;innerHTML &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* template */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;
      &amp;lt;style&gt;
        :host {
          box-sizing: border-box;
          display: inline-block;
          position: relative;
        }

        p {
          color: var( --label-color, #161616 );
          font-family: &#39;Open Sans&#39;, sans-serif;
          font-size: var( --label-font-size, 16px );
          font-weight: var( --label-font-weight, 400 );
          letter-spacing: var( --label-letter-spacing, 0.10px );
          line-height: var( --label-line-height, 24px );
          margin: var( --label-margin, 0 );
          padding: var( --label-padding, 0 );
          width: var( --label-width, 100% );
        }
      &amp;lt;/style&gt;
      &amp;lt;p part=&quot;label&quot;&gt;
        &amp;lt;slot&gt;&amp;lt;/slot&gt;
      &amp;lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Root&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;attachShadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;open&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;shadowRoot&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; template&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;content&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;cloneNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;customElements&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;kh-label&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; HoytLabel &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have included CSS variables for the paragraph element. Each of these set a default value for their respective style property. This is my approach. You might alternatively be inclined to use CSS &lt;code&gt;:root&lt;/code&gt; in your main CSS file, and define these variables there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think of a Svelte component, as an example, the styles are included in the same &lt;code&gt;*.svelte&lt;/code&gt; file. I like that the element and the styles are together, so I keep that approach in my components. I also like my styles to be closer to the component so that I do not have to go looking around to other files. I have also found that when using components, I want to nudge them slightly here or there. I like to do that nudging closer to the declaration to avoid inadvertant cascading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some design systems lock down the styles that can be used to force consistency across a large organization (again, see Amazon Cloudscape).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The component implementation here includes a &lt;code&gt;slot&lt;/code&gt; element. Anything placed inside the component declaration will show up there - between the &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; tags. The component is used (at this point) as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;kh-label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello world!&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;kh-label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adding Functionality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For almost every component I implement, I include a &lt;code&gt;hidden&lt;/code&gt; attribute. The &lt;code&gt;hidden&lt;/code&gt; attribute already exists in HTML, but when you are building custom elements, you need to decide how (or if) it should be implemented. When I use &lt;code&gt;hidden&lt;/code&gt;, I want the element to be removed from the DOM. In CSS terms, that is the &lt;code&gt;display: none&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;HoytLabel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; template &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;template&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    template&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;innerHTML &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* template */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;
      &amp;lt;style&gt;
        :host {
          box-sizing: border-box;
          display: inline-block;
          position: relative;
        }

        :host( [hidden] ) {
          display: none;
        }

        p {
          color: var( --label-color, #161616 );
          font-family: &#39;Open Sans&#39;, sans-serif;
          font-size: var( --label-font-size, 16px );
          font-weight: var( --label-font-weight, 400 );
          letter-spacing: var( --label-letter-spacing, 0.10px );
          line-height: var( --label-line-height, 24px );
          margin: var( --label-margin, 0 );
          padding: var( --label-padding, 0 );
        }
      &amp;lt;/style&gt;
      &amp;lt;p part=&quot;label&quot;&gt;
        &amp;lt;slot&gt;&amp;lt;/slot&gt;
      &amp;lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Root&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;attachShadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;open&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;shadowRoot&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; template&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;content&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;cloneNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;customElements&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;kh-label&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; HoytLabel &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the style block of the component, we use the &lt;code&gt;:host()&lt;/code&gt; selector to apply styling when a &lt;code&gt;hidden&lt;/code&gt; attribute is present in the component instance. We can then make the component hidden using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;kh-label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello world.&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;kh-label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy enough. Another attribute I like to add is &lt;code&gt;concealed&lt;/code&gt; which toggles the CSS &lt;code&gt;visibility&lt;/code&gt; property for the times I do not want to remove the element from the DOM, but just make it invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;:host( [concealed] )&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;visibility&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; hidden&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;kh-label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;concealed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello world.&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;kh-label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you want text to be truncated with an ellipsis (by default in this configuration text will wrap). For this, we can implement a &lt;code&gt;truncate&lt;/code&gt; attribute, that gets applied to the contained paragraph element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;:host( [truncate] ) p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; hidden&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;text-overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; ellipsis&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;white-space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; nowrap&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;kh-label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token special-attr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token value css language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 150px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;truncate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello world, or some other really long greeting.&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;kh-label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice! Now we are having some fun. Let us keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you can style the &lt;code&gt;Label&lt;/code&gt; component using the CSS variables, some design systems may not want to leave the options that wide open. They still recognize that there will be different style choices in different contexts, but they do not want developers departing from the system (prescribed look and feel). A happy middle ground here is to supply attributes that style the element, but do so within a range of fixed possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the font color for example. Design systems will have already decided what the default color will be (usually slightly off-black). What if you want to use the &lt;code&gt;Label&lt;/code&gt; component in an error situation? You will most likely want to change the font color to some variation of red. In a design system, that variation of red will already have been determined for you. In this fashion, any time an error is presented, across any of the applications using the design system, will show the same color of red. This means that rather than add a &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; attribute that takes any color value, that color reflects usage. It is that usage that is assigned to the &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; attribute - and by extension helps to describe the usage of the component instance in the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;:host( [disabled] ) p, :host( [color=disabled] ) p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #656871&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;:host( [color=error] ) p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #db0000&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;:host( [color=info] ) p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #006ce0&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;:host( [color=success] ) p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #00802f&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;:host( [color=warning] ) p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #855900&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;kh-label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;error&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello world.&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;kh-label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same approach is often used for font sizing and font-weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;:host( [size=&#39;body-xs&#39;] ) p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 12px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;line-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 16px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;:host( [size=&#39;body-sm&#39;] ) p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 14px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;line-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 20px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;:host( [size=&#39;heading-xs&#39;] ) p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 16px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;line-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 20px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;:host( [size=&#39;heading-sm&#39;] ) p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 18px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;line-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 22px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;:host( [weight=light] ) p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 300&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;:host( [weight=bold] ) p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 700&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;kh-label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;error&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;body-xs&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;bold&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello world.&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;kh-label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where having a &lt;code&gt;Label&lt;/code&gt; component in your design system really starts to shine as compared to using a paragraph element. The API of the component can inform developers of the expected usage, while at the same time ensuring consistency. Think of the 200+ products offerred by Amazon Web Services. Each has it&#39;s own team of developers. Each has it&#39;s own UX/UI needs. Yet (like them or not) they all look the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extending Functionality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to this point we have been adding attributes and applying corresponding styles all with CSS - no additional JavaScript code needed. With this approach, if you want an attribute to be updated dynamically, you would have to use the &lt;code&gt;setAttribute()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; label &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;kh-label&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
label&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;weight&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;bold&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Or to remove&lt;/span&gt;
label&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;removeAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;weight&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you directly set &lt;code&gt;label.weight = &#39;bold&#39;&lt;/code&gt;, then no changes to the label will appear to take place. There is work being done - a property called &lt;code&gt;weight&lt;/code&gt; is being set on the &lt;code&gt;Label&lt;/code&gt; instance. Just like any JavaScript object, you can apply random properties all you want. They will not do anything, but you can apply them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get at the root cause of this behavior, we have to think a little more critically about what it is that we are trying to accomplish with the use of &lt;code&gt;label.weight = &#39;bold&#39;&lt;/code&gt;. What we really want to happen is for the attribute &lt;code&gt;weight&lt;/code&gt; to be added to the component instance, and the value of &lt;code&gt;bold&lt;/code&gt; to be assigned to that attribute. This will in turn trigger the CSS styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the distinction here between setting a property and setting an attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we want a Web Component property and attribute to have the same behavior, that is called reflection. To get basic reflection, we add access methods (get/set) to the component, and have those methods update the attributes accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;HoytLabel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;HTMLElement&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; template &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;template&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    template&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;innerHTML &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* template */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not as slick as data binding with a Svelte rune, but it also does not add much complexity. One set of access methods per reflected property. You can also add a bit of syntactic sugar in these accessors to handle primitive types more gracefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Boolean&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;a-float&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; value &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;removeAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;a-float&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Integer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;anInteger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;hasAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;an-integer&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;parseInt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;an-integer&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;anInteger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; value &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;an-integer&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; value &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;removeAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;an-integer&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These also have the nice side effect of presenting a &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; value when the attribute/property is not set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web Component attributes cannot be complex objects, but that does not mean that properties cannot. If you want to handle a &lt;code&gt;Date&lt;/code&gt; object for example, you can add access methods. The implementation of those methods will change the internal state, and update the component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;aDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;_aDate&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;aDate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;_aDate &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; value &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now though, let us get back to our label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web Components having slots is important for composition of content - just as most HTML elements can contain other markup. In the case of a &lt;code&gt;Label&lt;/code&gt; the content might be a long form description. An actual paragraph would be hard to read as an attribute. There are times however when the content you want the label to display is relatively short - most application labels come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are inclined to add an access method for a &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; attribute, then you are on the right path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also need to observe the changes to that attribute using the Web Components API, and apply changes where we want. In the case of the paragraph element, that looks something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;observedAttributes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;text&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;attributeChangedCallback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; old&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; name &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;text&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;$label&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;textContent &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; value &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;        
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to be careful here, though. If &lt;code&gt;this.$label&lt;/code&gt; points to the &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; element, setting the &lt;code&gt;textContent&lt;/code&gt; will remove the &lt;code&gt;slot&lt;/code&gt; element. While that works, it is not particularly friendly. We want to allow developers to use &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; as an attribute and a property, but also compose the content should they so desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I like to do here is put a &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; inside the &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;, and have &lt;code&gt;this.$label&lt;/code&gt; point to the &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt;. If you want things really tidy, you can even add a splash more CSS to hide the &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; if there is no &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;:host( :not( [text] ) ) span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; none&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, but what does all of this have to do with a &lt;code&gt;Label&lt;/code&gt; component in a design system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I set the &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; property, I treat that as a signal that the component will be updated dynamically at runtime. If the text content is composed (inside the component markup), then that is a signal that the content will not change at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Will not change --&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;kh-label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello world.&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;kh-label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Will change at runtime --&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;kh-label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;Hello world.&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;kh-label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This becomes manifest in the code as well. I am never thinking &amp;quot;Should I be using &lt;code&gt;textContent&lt;/code&gt; here?&amp;quot; Programmatically, it is always &lt;code&gt;label.text&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; label &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;kh-label&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
label&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;text &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Hello, Kevin.&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use this pattern throughout my components. I lean on composability where possible, but if an element is going to change at runtime, I provide a means to use a property (without damaging slotted content if I can help it). With a &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt; component as an example, I provide a &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt; property that can be set dynamically at runtime. If I am reading the markup, and the &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt; component has text content between the opening and closing tags, then the label of that button will not be changing at runtime. When I am updating the label of a button at runtime, I always use &lt;code&gt;Button.label&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where this really starts to get interesting is in more complex controls such as a list. Differentiating a &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt; from a &lt;code&gt;Link&lt;/code&gt; and presenting an anchor element in place of the button element when an &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; attribute is present is another fun example. I will cover these in future posts. Until then, feel free to check out my complete Web Component template on &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/krhoyt/c0fbb7ad1fbb1bdf8e808115e6d62487&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Is it vibe coding or vibe debugging? Is AI assisting you or making you lazy? Is the industry shutting out junior developers or making them more productive more quickly? These are hard, often philosophical questions. Once thing is sure however - AI is here to stay. Refusing to acknowledge AI, and to learn how to use it for your workflow(s), is putting your head in the sand and ignoring the inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is where my experiment with Warp began - somewhere between curiosity and skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first got to work with AI back in 2017 while at IBM. Back then we did not really refer to it as AI as much as machine learning (ML, or AI/ML at best). IBM Watson provided various ML-oriented services, and we developer advocates were first on the ground to teach other developers how to use those services. This included everything from transcription and sentiment analysis to image recognition, and even building custom models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2022 while at Amazon where I managed the documentation team focused on &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/&quot;&gt;SageMaker&lt;/a&gt; (custom ML models). Of course ChatGPT launched in 2022 as well, and generative AI in general began its explosive adoption rate. Technical writers generate text, too, so we were very interested in what these new tools could do for us. We were not about to send documentation for unreleased product to a public API, but when &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock&quot;&gt;Amazon Bedrock&lt;/a&gt; was released, providing data protections, we jumped at the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With collaboration and input from a team of technical writers, I built tooling that leveraged generative AI from the ground up to see what we could do. Ownership was eventually handed off to an engineering team who scaled the project across the 200+ organization of writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, in a freelance capacity, I have gone deeper into generative AI for my customers. This work has included vector and graph databases against custom datasets, as well as agentic tooling such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://n8n.io/&quot;&gt;n8n&lt;/a&gt;. Along the way, I have used ChatGPT and Claude Code extensively to help me with complex algorithms, and even to scaffold projects and features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of opinions on my exposure to all these technologies, but that is not the point of all this background. The point is that I have a broad experience with both generative AI as well as ML, both from a user and implementation perspective. I recently had the opportunity to bring that significant practical experience to kick the tires on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warp.dev/&quot;&gt;Warp’s Agentic Development Environment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure, I am actively seeking new work. If you find any of this background inline with what you need for your organization, then feel free to reach out on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/parkerkrhoyt/&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moving at Warp Speed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warp calls itself an ‘agentic development environment’ - which means it does not just execute your commands, it helps you decide what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warp surfaces as a replacement for your terminal. Warp allows you to interact with the command line like you would with any other terminal. When Warp detects natural language it switches out to a generative mode. The default settings choose a model and approach that is most efficient, but you can choose your own adventure as well for those times you need more reasoning from the model. Features and settings abound to let you customize how Warp interacts with both you the developer, and the underpinning models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hiring Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, I used the Warp &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/warpdotdev/hiring-challenge&quot;&gt;hiring challenge&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. The hiring challenge presents you with a data file of space missions. The data file weighs in at over 9 Mb, and contains over 100,000 missions. The columns for each data row are separated by a pipe &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; symbol, but there are comments and other labels in there to keep things interesting. The objective, as outlined in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/warpdotdev/hiring-challenge/blob/main/mission_challenge.md&quot;&gt;challenge description&lt;/a&gt; is to use Warp to generate an AWK command to parse the data file and determine the security code of the longest successful Mars mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the thing though... The description reads like a product requirements document (PRD). My first instinct then was to clone the repository and tell Warp to deliver on the PRD. This worked out well because when you first install and run Warp, and head off to start a new project, you will be given the opportunity to do just that - import a repository. Warp automatically read the PRD, and got to work on generating the AWK command. Along the way, it checked itself too, which is reassuring. A few minutes later, I had the command and the desired output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, um, that was easy. Suspiciously easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going Deeper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I have run across AWK before, I would never claim to be an expert in its syntax, so I asked Warp to generate a Node.js file that would complete the challenge. Again, a few minutes later, I had what I wanted in a language/syntax with which I was familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reviewing the code, I found it to be complete and comprehensive. It was not quite what I would have written myself, but I appreciated the nod to async/callback processing given the size of the data file. I ran the script and was presented with the same answer as the AWK command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I had clicked a few buttons, and run a few commands - easily toggling between natural language and classic CLI along the way. I had spent about thirty minutes (including the install and sign up), and had set aside an afternoon. Time to ratchet things up a notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Complexity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I really wanted the answer presented by the PRD, then I would import the data file into a database, and use the magic of SQL to dial in an answer. Okay, Warp, generate a Node.js file to put the missions into a SQLite database. And it did. It even installed a modern library to work with SQLite. I ran the script, and moments later had myself a nice little SQLite file. I opened up &lt;a href=&quot;https://tableplus.com/&quot;&gt;TablePlus&lt;/a&gt;, and ran some SQL. Yup, same answer. All systems go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know why, but I chose to write the SQL by hand myself. Old habits die hard? Scared of being confronted with the reality that the tool was killing what took me decades of experience to learn? Denial?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had not hit a roadblock yet with Warp. It had even gone above and beyond in some cases. It is not a real test until you have broken something, so time to get back at it. If I had a database, I figured I might as well take the next step and turn it into an REST API. I wanted to dial up the specificity a bit so I asked Warp to generate a serverless function to be deployed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/&quot;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warp did deliver a serverless function, and that function worked, but it was an older, non-ESM, implementation. It also did not take into consideration any CORS and/or bot handling. I did not ask Warp to do that, so not really a big miss, but it opened the door to push the edge a bit more. Rather than iterate through these changes, I pointed Warp to an example Netlify serverless function I had from another project. Warp adapted seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. This is just too fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I am ultimately looking for a specific answer, not just a data dump, we are going to need some sorting and filtering URL parameters. What say you, Warp? Yeah, no problem. I deployed and hit the API through the browser, added my sort and filter requirements, and just like that I had the same answer staring at me from the first row of the JSON results. Well, I guess the only thing left is a UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Home Sweet UI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent 15 years at Adobe, most of that time spent teaching developers to implement cutting edge user interfaces (with Flash, Flex, and ultimately web standards across devices), user interface development and design is a bit of a sweet spot for me. It feels comfortable. It is the basis of what enabled me to build the generative AI tooling at Amazon. My first role at IBM was actually testing developer SDKs for completeness and idiomatic usage across Android (Java) and iOS (Swift).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svelte 5 makes for an interesting test for generative AI solutions. Svelte 5 was released just around the time of some of the major cut lines LLMs. Features have been added since then some LLMs simply do not know about. Also, I wanted to play with some of those new features myself, so I headed down the Svelte 5 path for this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I implemented the UI myself, again wanting to experience these new features first hand, but I now found myself confidently asking Warp for code snippets whenever needed. Warp had become an ally. The assistance I asked Warp for ranged from building the REST URL dynamically from user interactions, to one-liners around media queries and other markup that I was too lazy to research myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went to build the Svelte project, I needed to change the adapter for my static SPA approach. Warp handled that for me without a problem. &lt;a href=&quot;https://hire-me-warp.netlify.app/&quot;&gt;Check out&lt;/a&gt; the final results. The application is responsive, supports mobile, and includes sorting on columns, as well as status filtering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hire-me-warp.netlify.app/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kevinhoyt.com/img/assets/warp.test.drive.png&quot; alt=&quot;Space Missions&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Was Missing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that I barely touched the full capabilities of Warp. I will be honest, I was expecting it to bomb. It just kept getting better. Hindsight, if I had expected Warp to be this good, I probably would have just written PRDs for the various features I ended up building, and then had it generate the implementation. My experience with other generative AI tooling for developers had taught me that was a bad idea, so I went at the challenge piecemeal. I still got across the finish line, and in record time with a code base I trusted, but it would be an interesting experiment to try PRD-driven development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature I found that I wanted but that was not there is the ability to use local LLMs. There is a lot of really innovative work going on outside the big players. There are features provided by open source LLMs, such as image generation, that I think would really round out the experience. For enterprise or privacy-conscious workflows, such as the generative tooling I made at Amazon, local LLM support would be a game changer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I did not really use the &amp;quot;agentic&amp;quot; aspect of Warp. Warp was fast enough, and complete enough, and accurate enough, and this project was small enough that it never really surfaced as a need. That being said, when I think of agentic workflows as presented by tooling such as n8n, I think there is a lot of room for Warp to expand. Warp sees the input to an agentic workflow as a prompt. There is no reason it could not watch files, directories, support tickets, etc. and get to work without me needing to prompt. Put together with local LLMs and I could see tasks like product image resizing, icon generation, etc. without additional token costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, Warp is a fantastic improvement to my experience with other generative AI tooling. If you are looking to pull your head out of the sand and get acclimated to this new AI-powered future of development, you do not need to look any further than Warp. Personally, I came expecting a terminal replacement with some AI bells and whistles. I left convinced that the future of development is not about AI replacing us - it is about AI working &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; us. Warp gets that balance right.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite aspects of &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/&quot;&gt;Svelte&lt;/a&gt; is that it adds robust data binding to the Web, and then gets out of the way. Do not get me wrong, data binding with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tc39/proposal-observable&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy&quot;&gt;Proxy&lt;/a&gt; added to the standard is great. I know that is what Svelte is using under the hood - which makes me happy - but the syntactic sugar afforded by the Svelte compiler is pure joy. Until it is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my applications, &lt;a href=&quot;https://flavorawesome.com/&quot;&gt;Flavor Awesome&lt;/a&gt;, depends heavily on data binding to unknown form elements created at runtime by external metadata. This configuration creates a complex data binding scenario from which I have learned a lot. In this post I will dive deep into some of the more obscure data binding scenarios that I either missed, or that are not covered well, in the Svelte documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Counter Component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When describing data binding (the &lt;code&gt;$state&lt;/code&gt; rune) in a component, the Svelte documentation presents a counter value that is a &lt;code&gt;Number&lt;/code&gt;. When you click an increment button, the counter is incremented by one. The inverse is true for decrementing the count. Svelte then updates the display of the counter in the HTML as it detects the change. It goes something like this…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; decrease &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;$lib/assets/arrow-down.svg&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; increase &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;$lib/assets/arrow-up.svg&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;$state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onDecreaseClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onIncreaseClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;article&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;button 
    aria&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Decrease&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 
    disabled&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 
    onclick&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;onDecreaseClick&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 
    type&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;button&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;img alt&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Arrow pointing down&quot;&lt;/span&gt; src&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;decrease&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;count&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;button 
    aria&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Increase&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 
    onclick&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;onIncreaseClick&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 
    type&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;button&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;img alt&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Arrow pointing up&quot;&lt;/span&gt; src&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;increase&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;article&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! Wow! Data binding with Svelte is magical and easy to use. If you want to seed the counter value from outside of the component, you remove the &lt;code&gt;$state&lt;/code&gt; rune, and replace it with a property value (&lt;code&gt;$props&lt;/code&gt;). This is defined as such...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;$props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you change the counter value inside the component, that change happens only inside the component itself. If you want the change to bubble up, then you need to add an event listener to the component. When the counter is changed inside the component, you make the change, and then call the event listener, passing the new counter value as an argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; onchange&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;$props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onDecreaseClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; onchange &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onchange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onIncreaseClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; onchange &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onchange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are binding the counter value to the component, then you do not even need to make the change to the counter in the component itself. When the change is made to the counter value outside of the component, it will be updated inside the component as well. Data binding magic once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Counter As A Property&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been brief in this review of Svelte data binding because it is covered well in the documentation. If you need more detail, I would suggest heading over to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/playground/component-bindings&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; to brush up before continuing with this post. Here is the catch: What happens when the counter is not a &lt;code&gt;Number&lt;/code&gt; value, but rather a &lt;code&gt;Number&lt;/code&gt; property on a custom &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;? This is where things get interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be inclined to perform the same operations, but on the relevant property. Something like...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// This will cause an error&lt;/span&gt;
item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you do this, you will get an error from Svelte. The error is displayed as &lt;code&gt;ownership_invalid_mutation&lt;/code&gt;. A description of the problem is provided with the error, and you can go down a rabbit hole trying to understand it. I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you have to think of &lt;code&gt;$state&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$props&lt;/code&gt; as different things. The &lt;code&gt;$state&lt;/code&gt; rune will monitor property changes. A component property (&lt;code&gt;$props&lt;/code&gt;) is a snapshot of the value being passed into the component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, when you make a change to the value of a component property, and that value is a primitive such as &lt;code&gt;Number&lt;/code&gt;, then you will not get the error. When the value being passed to the component is an &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; however, and then you change a property of that &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;, Svelte is telling you that the component does not own the original &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;. More specifically, it is saying that the property changes on the &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; will not be applied because unlike &lt;code&gt;$state&lt;/code&gt;, the component property is a snapshot, not a state value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Updating the Property&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have two choices in this scenario. This first is to use the event listener to bubble up the changed value. That change then gets applied at the level where it is owned (&lt;code&gt;$state&lt;/code&gt;), and the subsequent data bindings are updated in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;$state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onDecreaseClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; onchange &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onchange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the complexity of your components, this works great. If your components are heavily nested, then you may have to bubble up the change repeatedly until the change gets to a place where the owner (&lt;code&gt;$state&lt;/code&gt;) can be modified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Flavor Awesome, the form fields are components, and they live inside a form component. That form component tracks changes on the source &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;, but that &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; is itself a component property. Because I am using metadata to define the form, the &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; properties may be different. The form component is also responsible for validation before bubbling up the modified &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; when the changes are committed. Using the bubbling approach then creates an event listener mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onDecreaseClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; item &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    item &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; count&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; onchange &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onchange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; item &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second option is to modify the property of the &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; at the form level, and then have the changes updated through data binding. When the form is filled out, and validated, the modified &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; is then bubbled. As we have just seen however, modifying an &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; property will result in an error because the form component does not own the original &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick here is to replace the &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; property &lt;strong&gt;in its entirety&lt;/strong&gt; at the form level through Object destructuring. This will trigger data binding at the form level, and update the form field component appropriately. We are effectively working on the snapshot of the &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; until it is ready to be bubbled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On Snapshots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the bubbled changes reach the owner, and you have made changes to the original &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;, you may want to use &lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt; to verify the contents before you write the code to commit the changes. If you use &lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt; on the owning object you will get a different Svelte error that reads &lt;code&gt;console_log_state&lt;/code&gt;. This error is presented because you are logging the &lt;code&gt;Proxy&lt;/code&gt; object that holds the &lt;code&gt;$state&lt;/code&gt; value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; $state&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;snapshot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; item &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the &lt;code&gt;$state&lt;/code&gt; rune has a &lt;code&gt;snapshot()&lt;/code&gt; method you can use to get a copy of the &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; itself at that point in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;$state.snapshot()&lt;/code&gt; method is useful in other scenarios as well. Flavor Awesome uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API&quot;&gt;IndexedDB&lt;/a&gt; to manage data locally in the browser. You can put a &lt;code&gt;$state&lt;/code&gt; value into IndexedDB collection, but what you will be storing is the &lt;code&gt;Proxy&lt;/code&gt; object, not the value of the &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; that &lt;code&gt;Proxy&lt;/code&gt; is watching. What we want is the actual &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; value. Here, you can use the &lt;code&gt;$state.snapshot()&lt;/code&gt; method to get that original &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; before you insert it into the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data binding with Svelte is very powerful. As Uncle Ben says though &amp;quot;With great power comes great responsibility.&amp;quot; Understanding the data on which you are operating becomes a very important aspect of developing with Svelte. Hopefully this post has shed some light on the deeper nuances of that process - especially as it relates to components. If you want to play with the concepts further, the code for this post is available as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/krhoyt/609e2f6b950355e9b051dc1904534cbb&quot;&gt;GitHub Gist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Getting Comfortable with Circles</title>

      <updated>2025-07-15T00:00:00Z</updated>

      <summary>When is the last time you installed a module or library because you thought the task was too hard (or time consuming) to tackle yourself?

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When is the last time you installed a module or library because you thought the task was too hard (or time consuming) to tackle yourself? On the front end, this scenario can quickly lead to a resulting application that is considerably larger than it needs to be. You might be surprised to discover that some of the tasks that you might think of as hard, such as charts, animation, and date handling, can actually be pretty straightforward - and have a big impact on the size and performance of your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is the first in a series that delves into some of those areas that cause most developers to reach for a third-party library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take for example the humble circle. Sure, you took trigonometry at some point in the past, but who remembers the implications of all those sine, cosine, tangent, and hypotenuse calculations? I mean, where in my brain am I going to put the Marvel Cinematic Universe story arcs if I do not make some space up there? And then along comes a radar chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kevinhoyt.com/img/assets/radar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Radar chart&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the rest of this post, we will tackle building this radar chart from scratch. Along the way you will pick up a handful of lines of math that make it all possible; opening the door to building your own custom charts that are light-weight and blazing fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Radar Chart Deconstructed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we jump into the code, let us take a moment to look at the radar chart above. Calm down. Center yourself. What are the parts that make up the chart? There are clearly some labels around the outside of the chart. The chart itself is a circle, which means a specific radius. This chart has nested circles. There are five circles in total, and five labels (though the number of circles and labels are unrelated). It also looks like there are two datasets being plotted, each with a different color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is where we will start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;COLORS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;#1f78b4&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;#46a040&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;LABELS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Power tools&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Electrical supplies&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Plumbing items&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Garden tools&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Plants&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;LEVELS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;RADIUS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;150&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;STEPS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;RADIUS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;LEVELS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;SVGNS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;    

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; data &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;900&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;900&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;900&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;900&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;650&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Find maximum value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; maximum &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; d &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; d &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; d&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; v &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; v &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;d&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; v&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    maximum &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;d&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;v&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; maximum &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;d&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;v&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; maximum&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// SVG elements&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; svg &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;svg&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; chart &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;g&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have manually extrapolated the data represented in the chart - an &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; with one &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; each for the data being plotted. Each of those &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; have five data points. There are five elements in the &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; because there are five labels, not because there are five circles. I have also found the maximum value in the dataset. Sometimes you may also need to find the minimum, but it is clear from the picture that zero is the minimum in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have also noticed the &lt;code&gt;SVGNS&lt;/code&gt; variable with a URL as the value. We will be using SVG to render our chart, and some SVG DOM operations require the SVG namespace, so this variable is there simply for brevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;svg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;300&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;300&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;svg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SVG element gets a default size in the DOM, and we will be playing with that a little later. For now, I set a &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;300&lt;/code&gt; just to give us some space while we are working. The &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; or &amp;quot;group&amp;quot; element is what will hold all the elements we generate to create our chart. The group element is your friend when working with SVG. It opens the door for more targetted transformations, which again, we will get to later. While we are here, the last two lines of the JavaScript code snippet above, grabs references to each of the two main SVG element from the DOM. We will use these both pretty extensively moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Circles Everywhere&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a good description of our radar chart, let us get to the drawing. We will start with those five nested circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Circles&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;LEVELS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; circle &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createElementNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;SVGNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;circle&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  circle&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setAttributeNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;r&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; steps &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  chart&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; circle &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop here is setup to start at one, and then iterate five times (&lt;code&gt;LEVELS === 5&lt;/code&gt;). Why not set the iterator to zero, and then go until &lt;code&gt;c &amp;lt; LEVELS&lt;/code&gt; like most loops? That would give us five circles, but the first circle would have a radius of zero. The result would appear to be only four circles. We want five circles, with the zero radius circle at the center implied. That means we need to shift our loop by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will notice that we are not worrying about the positioning of the circles. We create the circles and put them into the DOM. The default center will be zero on both the X and Y axes. This is the top-left corner of the SVG element, and makes the math easier moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The View Box&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run this code now, you will see only the bottom-right quadrant of the circles. We could calculate the center position, and set the coordinates of the circles, but SVG offers us a way to independantly control what part of the SVG content is visible. This parameter is called &lt;code&gt;viewBox&lt;/code&gt; and is set on the SVG element itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;svg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;300&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;300&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;viewBox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;-150 -150 300 300&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;svg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outside circle has a radius of 150 pixels. That is a diameter of 300 pixels. If the center of the circle is at &lt;code&gt;0, 0&lt;/code&gt; then 150 pixels of that circle are off the view of the SVG element, effectively placing the left-most pixel at -150 pixels. We can tell the SVG element about this with &lt;code&gt;viewBox&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;viewBox&lt;/code&gt; attribute takes four arguments - the left, top, width, and height of the viewport we would like to designate. By telling the &lt;code&gt;viewBox&lt;/code&gt; that the left and top are -150, and that there is a width and height of 300, then we will see the full set of circles, not just the bottom-right quadrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In advanced manipulations of &lt;code&gt;viewBox&lt;/code&gt; you may need to calculate ratios of the content to be displayed relative to the dimensions of the SVG element itself. This is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but I will pick it up in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Radians and Degrees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five spokes on the radar chart are set at an equal number of degrees apart. There are fives spokes (one for each label). Each spoke starts at 0, 0 and goes to a point on the outer circle some number of degrees separated from the previous spoke. We need to know what the X and Y coordinates are for those points. Okay, here comes the circle math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Radians&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;degreesToRadians&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;degrees&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; degrees &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;PI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;180&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Degrees make sense to you and I. For example, we can think of 360 degrees in a circle. The trigonometric functions we will work with do not want degrees as an argument, they want radians. Why radians? What exactly is a radian? In drawing circles and lines, we do not really care. Sure, there is a perfectly reasonable maths explaination, but we do not care. All we care about is that we convert our degrees to the radian unit desired when working with these functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Spokes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; s &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; s &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;LABELS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; s&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; angle &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;degreesToRadians&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;360&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;LABELS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; s &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;90&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;RADIUS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;cos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; angle &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; y &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;RADIUS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; angle &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; path &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createElementNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;SVGNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;path&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  path&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;spoke&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  path&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setAttributeNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;d&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;M 0 0 L &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;x&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;y&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  chart&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; path &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for each of the labels we will draw a &amp;quot;spoke&amp;quot;. The angle of that spoke is based on the index of the iteration. To get the X-coordinate we use &lt;code&gt;Math.cos( angle )&lt;/code&gt; of the angle we are interested in getting. We multiply by the &lt;code&gt;RADIUS&lt;/code&gt; of the outer circle to project out along that angle to the point where the line will intercept the circle. To get the Y-coordinate we do the same thing, but use &lt;code&gt;Math.sin( angle )&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is it. That is all the circle math you need to know - use radians, &lt;code&gt;Math.cos()&lt;/code&gt; is the X-coordinate, and &lt;code&gt;Math.sin()&lt;/code&gt; is the Y-coordinate. If you have those three rules in your head, you can have all kinds of fun with circle math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In SVG, a spoke will be represented as a &lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; element. The &lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; element takes a series of numbers and letters that indicate a description (&lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; attribute) of what is to be drawn. You can go down a rabbit hole with this, but we will stick to &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; for &amp;quot;move to&amp;quot; and &lt;code&gt;L&lt;/code&gt; for &amp;quot;line to&amp;quot;. Each value is followed by an X and Y-coordinate respectively. To draw a spoke, we describe the line as &amp;quot;move to 0, 0 and then draw a line to X and Y&amp;quot; and determined by the circle math we just performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plotting the Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To plot the data, we use the exact same rules as the spokes - radians, &lt;code&gt;Math.cos()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Math.sin()&lt;/code&gt;. Indeed the iteration of the dataset starts off with pretty much the same code as from the spokes. The only subtle difference is that we are not going to multiply by &lt;code&gt;RADIUS&lt;/code&gt; because that would always be 150 pixels. We want the plot of the data to reflect the values in the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Map range&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; in_min&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; in_max&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; out_min&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; out_max&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; ratio &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; value &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; in_min &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; in_max &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; in_min &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; out_min &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; ratio &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; out_max &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; out_min &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;      
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, when we setup the description of the radar chart, we determined the maximum value in the dataset. In this case, that is 900. The radius of the circle is only 150 pixels. Drawing a plot line at 900 pixels would not even show up on our 300x300 SVG element. We need to map the dataset value relative to the radius of the circle. The map function here takes a value, the range in which that value falls, and target range to which we want to relate. In this case, 900 becomes 150. A value of 450 would become 75, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually picked up this algorithm when working with microcontrollers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first iteration of each of the two datasets, we do not want to move to 0, 0 before drawing. We want to move to the first coordinate of the relative/mapped value. We only want that move to happen on the first iteration (index of zero). After that we want to draw a line to the relative/mapped coordinate. When we have finished a set of iterations for a dataset, we want to close the plot. We could calculate this and draw another line, but SVG gives us the &lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; command which tells the path to close itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set the &lt;code&gt;stroke&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; representing the dataset on the element directly as the colors change. For the &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; specifically, I take the six-digit hexadecimal value, and append &lt;code&gt;40&lt;/code&gt; to it, representing an alpha channel value (opacity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Label the Values&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in the home stretch now! The radar chart example that we are referencing, displays values on the vertical axis. You might be inclined to reach for our three rules again - radians, &lt;code&gt;Math.cos()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Math.sin()&lt;/code&gt; - but we already know the X-coordinate is zero (plus some pixels for spacing). All we need is the Y-coordinate where each of the circles intersects the vertical axis line, and the relative value that represents within the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Values&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;16&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt; might seem like &amp;quot;magic numbers&amp;quot;. These numbers are manually adjusted to keep the labels from bumping right up against the outer circle. Custom visual spacing tweak for the win!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; element will render the content using the top-left corner by default. That is to say that if the placement coordinates are 160, 130, that is where the top-left corner of the text content will be located. The result is that the content will render out across the chart contents itself. Fortunately, you can tell &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; what to use as an origin with the &lt;code&gt;dominant-baseline&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;text-anchor&lt;/code&gt; properties (representing vertical and horizontal respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, for the first value, the label at the top of the chart, we want an origin of bottom-center. At 90 degrees along, we want an origin of center-left. When we get to the other side of the circle, say at 270 degrees, we want an origin of center-right. I have not found a clean, mathematical way to calculate this placement, so I use the degrees of the placement in an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Label placement&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;placement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;index&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; degrees &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;360&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; index&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;code&gt;placement&lt;/code&gt; function is like the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; function in that it does not really change. It is a utility you can put aside and reference over and over again whenever you are build circle charts. If you have found a better approach, I would love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One More Thing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the hard parts of constructing and rendering our chart are complete. Unfortunately, some of the labels along the outside of the chart, especially the long one on the right, are being truncated by our SVG element dimensions. What we really want now is to take into consideration not just &lt;code&gt;RADIUS&lt;/code&gt;, which is where we got our &lt;code&gt;viewBox&lt;/code&gt; from initially, but also the new dimensions of the entire chart to include the labels; however long they may be. With those dimensions, we then want to adjust the &lt;code&gt;viewBox&lt;/code&gt; to display all the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; bounds &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; chart&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getBBox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
svg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;viewBox&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;bounds&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;x&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;bounds&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;y&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;bounds&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;width&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;bounds&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;height&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be familiar with &lt;code&gt;getBoundingClientRect()&lt;/code&gt;. We could use that here as well, but SVG elements actually give us &lt;code&gt;getBBox()&lt;/code&gt; which returns values designed to placed in the &lt;code&gt;viewBox&lt;/code&gt;. We make a call to &lt;code&gt;getBBox()&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;code&gt;chart&lt;/code&gt;, and then set the &lt;code&gt;viewBox&lt;/code&gt; accordingly. Now the entire chart, including the labels, will be displayed in the viewport of the SVG element. This holds true even if you resize the SVG element - for example, if you had a &lt;code&gt;grid&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;flex&lt;/code&gt; display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whew! That seems like a lot, right? I mean, at this point you might be thinking &amp;quot;I will just use the library, thanks.&amp;quot; And I get it. It is a lot... Of learning. The actual code is not even 200 lines of JavaScript. It is blazing fast, and because you wrote it, and understand the core principles, you can customize it to your heart&#39;s content. When a VP decides that they want a change on how things are displayed, you do not have to check and see if your library supports that customization. Now you can make the change directly yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here you might consider wrapping this up in a Web Component, and exposing some basic customization through CSS properties. Happy charting!&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If there is one &amp;quot;soft&amp;quot; skill that has served me the best during my two decades in Information Technology, it has to be time management. There are many approaches to time management. Entire systems have evolved to help. One of these is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity-ebook/dp/B00KWG9M2E/ref=sr_1_1?crid=8JR6JESZYA3E&amp;amp;keywords=getting+things+done&amp;amp;qid=1672181613&amp;amp;sprefix=getting+things+done%2Caps%2C214&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/a&gt;, or GTD, based on the book of the same name by author, David Allen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get as involved in GTD as you want. This is not that kind of post. This is a post about the decision making process at the core of GTD that you can use right now, without changing a single thing about how you work. This is GTD distilled down to the very core - do it, defer it, delegate it, drop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Primer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the core concepts in GTD is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; keeping information in your head. Keeping information in your head represents a cognitive load that slows you down, and will keep you awake at night. Our brains are horrible at tracking the myriad details that come with our lives in the modern era. The important information that should be in your head relates to your profession, not to the processes of the details that surround it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When new work arrives at your desk, in whatever form it may arrive, you have a decision to make. The decision is seemingly simple, yet we quickly arrive at analysis paralysis. Your email backs up. You start dropping important tasks. Missing opportunities. This is exactly because we are trying to keep all these details in our heads. To resolve this problem, GTD provides a decision matrix consisting of four simple categories - do it, defer it, delegate it, drop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When new work arrives at your desk, first ask yourself &amp;quot;Do I have time to address this right now?&amp;quot; If you do have the time, then do the work. Get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you do the work, I suggest putting the time you spent into a calendar. Over time this collection of work that you completed will give you a better picture of how you work, and the type of work you deal with most frequently. I even color-code the blocks of time in my calendar. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defer It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When new work arrives at your desk, if you do not have the time to &amp;quot;do it&amp;quot; then defer it until later. You accomplish this once again by heading to your calendar. Estimate the time that the work will take, and find a place for it on your calendar. Block off that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the time comes around again, be true to yourself, and do the work. If something else has come up, then move the block to a time when you can take care of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also of importance is the details of the work to be done. I load my calendar blocks with all the pertinent details that relate to that piece of work. In this manner, when I come to the task at some point in the future, I do not have to spend time digging up the references and refreshing the information in my brain. If the information I need is in the calendar block, then I am immediately brought up to speed on what it is exactly that I need to do. Deciding what is pertinent can require some experience to refine. When in doubt, put everything you think might be related into the appointment block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Delegate It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When new work arrives at your desk, it may not be work for you to do at all. Sometimes somebody else can take the work entirely, or at the very least, may need to take action on the work before you can proceed. When work of this nature arrives at your desk, you delegate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes with a caveat. While you may be master your time management, that does not mean that others are doing the same. They may still be trying to run everything out of their brains. They may be dropping things along the way. To account for this, turn once again to your calendar, and decide on a time to follow-up on the work. Block off time in your calendar to circle back on the progress with the person to whom the work was delegated. And again, be sure to put all the details in the calendar block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the time in your calendar comes back around in the future, you can follow-up with the pertinent individual. If they are not done with the work yet, then schedule an additional follow-up time in the future. In this manner, you transfer the cognitive load to somebody else until it is time for you to actually do the work. When the work is ready for you, then block off time in the calendar to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drop It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When new work arrives at your desk, there are times when you do not really need to do that work at all. Or there could be old work that you deferred or delegated that you no longer need to do. This is a moment for brutal honesty. Is this work something you really need to do? If the answer to that question is &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; then drop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as with deciding what information to put in your &amp;quot;do it&amp;quot; calendar blocks, this also takes some experience to get right. As you settle more into using the decision matrix, you will find that since the cognitive load is less, that the decisions become easier. That the decision becomes more clear. You may find that there was a significant amount of work you used to think was important, but that it was really just stuck in analysis paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally tend to be pretty heavy handed with &amp;quot;drop it&amp;quot; work. There is a lot of noise in the modern workflow. Dropping the work that is not actually important clears up the signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the work may not be important now, sometimes it becomes important later. For this reason, it it important to have a reliable archive system in place. This can take a number of forms. Depending on how often your email gets archived, filing the work away may be a good option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found that email archive and search is not particularly robust or reliable, so I create Markdown documents for work that may become important in the future. These generally take the form of &amp;quot;YYYY-MM-DD-work-label.md&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Color Coding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color coding your blocks of time can be a helpful tool. In one glance, you can quickly get an idea of where you are spending your time, and how your might choose to optimize. When I am traveling, I expect to see large blocks of time dedicated to getting to the airport, sitting on a plane, and getting to my destination. When I am ramping up for a major deadline, I expect to see large blocks of time dedicated to doing work. If I do not see these colors, then I know I am missing something, or that I am not appropriately aligned with the work that needs to get done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The labels I currently use for these colors are defined by where I work, Amazon. Amazon has a robust set of Leadership Principles (LP) that are infused across the company. You rarely go a day without hearing an LP. My labels are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coaching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connecting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delivering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Travel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These labels have changed over time, and continue to do so. This reflects the changing nature of my work, the nature of my role, or the employer for which I work. These labels may not work for you, but hopefully they are a good guide to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I had color codes and labels, I set out with blocking time using the decision matrix. After a month, I looked back at the time blocks and decided general categories that I saw surfacing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do it. Defer it. Delegate it. Drop it. The &amp;quot;Four D&amp;quot; system of time management thanks to a heavily distilled Getting Things Done. This requires no new tools. Only a calendar, and the occasional Markdown file are needed. You do not need to subscribe to some new service. You do not need to memorize shorthand symbols. You just put time on your calendar, and stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done effectively, with practice, people will begin to wonder just how it is that you get so much work done. You will be &amp;quot;that person&amp;quot; that always seems to be a step ahead of the curve. Meanwhile your cognitive load has declined significantly, you sleep better, your do not miss opportunities, and you generally feel less stressed. If that sounds good, then I encourage you to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

      <updated>2022-12-02T00:00:00Z</updated>

      <summary>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has so many services. A stroll through the catalog will likely yield something useful for just about any project. Sometimes our projects pick us.

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services (AWS) has so many services. A stroll through the catalog will likely yield something useful for just about any project. Sometimes our projects pick us. This week a customer asked for an example of using &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/&quot;&gt;AWS Transcribe&lt;/a&gt; with Python. Having used other transcription services, I could not pass up the challenge. What follows is my approach to implementing a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a little setup required to get all this going. I have tried to stick to the absolute minimum amount of setup. While walking through each of these setup steps is beyond the scope of this post, I will give you some pointers along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Access and Identity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use AWS, you will obviously need an account. With your account in hand, you can get the credentials you will need to access the AWS services. The danger with doing this is that if you are using the root account credentials, then those credentials have access to everything in your account. If you let those credentials slip into malicious hands - say, by accidentally committing them to a public GitHub account - then those hands can really cause you a lot of pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than use the root account credentials directly, I recommend heading over to the Identity Management (IAM) service and creating a group with specific permissions for the services you will be using. In this case, those permissions are &amp;quot;Transcribe&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;S3&amp;quot;. Then create a user and generate credentials for that user. Finally, assign that user to the group that has the appropriate permissions. Now should those credentials fall into malicious hands, the only access they have is to those services specified for the group. If you suspect malicious activity, you can log into the root account and disable the user and/or group with a few clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;S3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to provide the audio file for Transcribe to use, you will need a place in AWS to put that file; namely an S3 bucket. If you already have an S3 Bucket setup, you can use that, or even create a folder inside of that bucket if you do not want your Transcribe content to co-mingle with other content you may have in the bucket. However you go about it, note the region in which the bucket resides. You will need this piece of information to use both Transcribe and S3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Python&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few moving pieces on the Python side of this solution. The first is a file to put your environment variables. What environment variables? Namely, those all so precious access keys. You want to avoid putting those access keys directly into your Python code (or any language you may be using). There are also some other variables that are used throughout this solution that go nicely into that environment file. In a file named &lt;code&gt;transcribe.env&lt;/code&gt; I have placed the following variable details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;AWS_ACCESS_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;_YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_
&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;AWS_SECRET_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_
&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;AWS_REGION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;_S3_REGION_
&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;LOCAL_AUDIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;hello-world.m4a
&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;S3_BUCKET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;_S3_BUCKET_NAME_
&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;S3_OBJECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;_PATH_TO_AUDIO_IN_BUCKET_
&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;SLEEP_TIME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;TRANSCRIPTION_JOB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;hello-world&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will talk about these environment variables in more detail as we get into the specific Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, you will need to install two Python libraries. Again, I have tried to keep this pretty minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html&quot;&gt;Boto3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the AWS library for Python. While AWS is mostly REST under the covers, trying to manage the headers and structure of the requests yourself can be very overwhelming. While I am not a fan of adding libraries for the sake of adding libraries, this is one case where it absolutely makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/&quot;&gt;DotEnv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: You have externalized key pieces of data into an environment variable file. That is great! Now we need a way to pull them into our main logic, parse them, and make use of them. Like anything Python, there are a dozen ways to do this, but I find this little helper worth the value to have along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing libraries will look something like &lt;code&gt;pip install boto3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything else used in this solution is a part of the standard Python runtime. Oh, and it is worth mentioning that this is all Python 3 code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ready, Set...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solution uses a variety of libraries, both third-party as mentioned above, and from the Python runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; boto3
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; io
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; json
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; os
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; sys
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; time

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; dotenv &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; load_dotenv
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; pathlib &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Path&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;boto3&lt;/strong&gt;: As previously mentioned, this is the Python AWS library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;io&lt;/strong&gt;: Allows reading the Transcribe results directly into memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;json&lt;/strong&gt;: Provides a means to parse and read the JSON data that often results from interacting with AWS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;os&lt;/strong&gt;: Used for access the environment variables once read and parsed by the supporting &lt;code&gt;dotenv&lt;/code&gt; library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sys&lt;/strong&gt;: Access to command-line arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;time&lt;/strong&gt;: Can pause execution while we poll the Transcribe service to see if it has completed its work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;from dotenv import load_dotenv&lt;/strong&gt;: Reads and parses the environment variable file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;from pathlib import Path&lt;/strong&gt;: Helps specify where the environment variable file lives on the local file system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Go!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first lines of code should be to read and parse the environment variables file so they can be used throughout the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;dotenv_path &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Path&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;transcribe.env&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
load_dotenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; dotenv_path &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Path&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;transcribe.env&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To access an AWS service, we must for instantiate a &amp;quot;client&amp;quot; for services we want to access. Client instantiation includes parameters specific to that service. We will need two clients since we are accessing two different services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;storage &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; boto3&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;client&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;s3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  aws_access_key_id &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;AWS_ACCESS_KEY&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  aws_secret_access_key &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;AWS_SECRET_KEY&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  region_name &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;AWS_REGION&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

transcribe &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; boto3&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;client&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;transcribe&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  aws_access_key_id &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;AWS_ACCESS_KEY&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  aws_secret_access_key &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;AWS_SECRET_KEY&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  region_name &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;AWS_REGION&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you can see those environment variables in action as referenced by &lt;code&gt;os.getenv( &amp;quot;variable_name&amp;quot; )&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Audio File&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS Transcribe works from an audio file placed on S3. Here we will check S3 to see if our desired audio file already exists. If it does not, we will upload an audio file from the local file system to S3 for later use by Transcribe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Transcribe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to tell AWS Transcribe to work on a specific audio file, we create a &amp;quot;job&amp;quot;. That job is asynchronous. That is to say that when we make the call to create a job, that call will kick off the job and return. It will not hold up execution of the logic while waiting for the job to complete. In order to find out if the job has completed, we will need to repeatedly ask Transcribe about the status of the job (polling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many parts of &lt;code&gt;Boto3&lt;/code&gt; include &lt;code&gt;waiters&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Waiters&lt;/code&gt; are a means of &lt;em&gt;waiting&lt;/em&gt; for the work on AWS to complete. Transcribe does not support &lt;code&gt;waiters&lt;/code&gt; at this time, so polling it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    completed &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;
    
  time&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;sleep&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;SLEEP_TIME&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a lot to take in at once. Let us review what is going on in the above snippet. First, we create a variable to track if the job is complete. Since it is not complete when we first create the job, the value of &lt;code&gt;completed&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we ask Transcribe for the status of the job. The job may not exist yet. If the job does not exist, we start a new job using the &lt;code&gt;start_transcription_job()&lt;/code&gt; function call. Among the parameters passed to the &lt;code&gt;start_transcription_job()&lt;/code&gt; includes the path to our audio file sitting on S3. Also specified is the path where Transcribe should place the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, after either of those calls are made, we check the progress in the resulting JSON dictionary. There are different values that might come back from checking on the job status. One of those might be an error. Another might be a failure to transcribe the content. In either of those cases, as well as in the case of the status being &lt;code&gt;COMPLETE&lt;/code&gt; we want to stop polling and move on to the next phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, is to continue checking on the job status - polling. We do not want to poll too aggressively here (DDoS), so we pause execution of the logic for a few seconds before checking again. The time that Transcribe will take to complete the job depends on the size of the audio file. Eventually the job will complete. Transcribe will then place the JSON formatted results in the bucket we specified when we started the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of this solution, we want to download the Transcribe results JSON file, and place it on the local file system so we can open it up with a text editor and learn about the various pieces of data that are included with the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;dir_index &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;S3_OBJECT&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;index&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
file_name &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;S3_OBJECT&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;dir_index&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;.json&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
storage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;download_file&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  Filename &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; file_name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  Bucket &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;S3_BUCKET&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  Key &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;S3_OBJECT&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;.json&quot;&lt;/span&gt;      
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; file_name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;r&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; local_file&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  response &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; json&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;load&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; local_file &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; response&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;results&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;transcripts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;transcript&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
  local_file&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;close&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;code&gt;S3_OBJECT&lt;/code&gt; environment variable includes some path information (&amp;quot;transcribe&amp;quot;). If we keep this as-is, then the download from S3 will try to put the results into a &amp;quot;transcribe&amp;quot; folder in our project on the local file system. I just want to put the results in the same folder as the Python program itself, so I take a few steps to parse out the file name from the rest of the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heading over to our S3 client instance, we then download the file. We can then open the file, and read the contents as JSON data, yielding a Python dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Gist, I also include a version of downloading the results file from S3, directly into memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any given transcription, there may be multiple results. I good next step might be to dig deeper into the results to determine the confidence of the various transcriptions, and then select a specific result. In this case, I am getting, and displaying, the first result only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cleanup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solution takes into account that you may want to reuse the audio file on S3, or just plain keep it around for archival purposes. If you have no intention of reusing any of the associated parts and pieces of the process, it is a good idea to clean up after ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;-c&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; sys&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;argv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  transcribe&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;delete_transcription_job&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    TranscriptionJobName &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;TRANSCRIPTION_JOB&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  
  response &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; storage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;delete_object&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    Bucket &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;S3_BUCKET&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    Key &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;S3_OBJECT&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To account for this, you can add a command-line argument of &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt; when you run the Python program. There is no significance to the &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt;. It is made up by me. The &amp;quot;c&amp;quot; stands for &amp;quot;cleanup&amp;quot;. If the &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt; argument is included, we delete the Transcribe job, and then delete the audio file from S3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All said and done, this solution is a little over 100 lines of code. Depending on how you fit this solution into your project, those lines of code could be much less or much more. This really all depends on how robust you need the code to be. Thanks to judicious use of the &lt;code&gt;boto3&lt;/code&gt; library however, you are on your way to using AWS Transcribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I absolutely appreciate these types of questions from AWS customers, and hope this example serves to answer questions around using AWS Transcribe with Python. For reference, I have placed the environment variable file (with security-specific values redacted), and the entirety of the Python program in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/krhoyt/46a8fac60cb25c44eaad9447e4c4685a&quot;&gt;GitHub Gist&lt;/a&gt; for your reference. Or copy and paste. Whatever. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
