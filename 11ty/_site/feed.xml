      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Is it vibe coding or vibe debugging? Is AI assisting you or making you lazy? Is the industry shutting out junior developers or making them more productive more quickly? These are hard, often philosophical questions. Once thing is sure however - AI is here to stay. Refusing to acknowledge AI, and to learn how to use it for your workflow(s), is putting your head in the sand and ignoring the inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is where my experiment with Warp began - somewhere between curiosity and skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first got to work with AI back in 2017 while at IBM. Back then we did not really refer to it as AI as much as machine learning (ML, or AI/ML at best). IBM Watson provided various ML-oriented services, and we developer advocates were first on the ground to teach other developers how to use those services. This included everything from transcription and sentiment analysis to image recognition, and even building custom models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2022 while at Amazon where I managed the documentation team focused on &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/&quot;&gt;SageMaker&lt;/a&gt; (custom ML models). Of course ChatGPT launched in 2022 as well, and generative AI in general began its explosive adoption rate. Technical writers generate text, too, so we were very interested in what these new tools could do for us. We were not about to send documentation for unreleased product to a public API, but when &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock&quot;&gt;Amazon Bedrock&lt;/a&gt; was released, providing data protections, we jumped at the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With collaboration and input from a team of technical writers, I built tooling that leveraged generative AI from the ground up to see what we could do. Ownership was eventually handed off to an engineering team who scaled the project across the 200+ organization of writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, in a freelance capacity, I have gone deeper into generative AI for my customers. This work has included vector and graph databases against custom datasets, as well as agentic tooling such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://n8n.io/&quot;&gt;n8n&lt;/a&gt;. Along the way, I have used ChatGPT and Claude Code extensively to help me with complex algorithms, and even to scaffold projects and features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of opinions on my exposure to all these technologies, but that is not the point of all this background. The point is that I have a broad experience with both generative AI as well as ML, both from a user and implementation perspective. I recently had the opportunity to bring that significant practical experience to kick the tires on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warp.dev/&quot;&gt;Warp’s Agentic Development Environment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure, I am actively seeking new work. If you find any of this background inline with what you need for your organization, then feel free to reach out on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/parkerkrhoyt/&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moving at Warp Speed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warp calls itself an ‘agentic development environment’ - which means it does not just execute your commands, it helps you decide what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warp surfaces as a replacement for your terminal. Warp allows you to interact with the command line like you would with any other terminal. When Warp detects natural language it switches out to a generative mode. The default settings choose a model and approach that is most efficient, but you can choose your own adventure as well for those times you need more reasoning from the model. Features and settings abound to let you customize how Warp interacts with both you the developer, and the underpinning models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hiring Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, I used the Warp &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/warpdotdev/hiring-challenge&quot;&gt;hiring challenge&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. The hiring challenge presents you with a data file of space missions. The data file weighs in at over 9 Mb, and contains over 100,000 missions. The columns for each data row are separated by a pipe &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; symbol, but there are comments and other labels in there to keep things interesting. The objective, as outlined in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/warpdotdev/hiring-challenge/blob/main/mission_challenge.md&quot;&gt;challenge description&lt;/a&gt; is to use Warp to generate an AWK command to parse the data file and determine the security code of the longest successful Mars mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the thing though... The description reads like a product requirements document (PRD). My first instinct then was to clone the repository and tell Warp to deliver on the PRD. This worked out well because when you first install and run Warp, and head off to start a new project, you will be given the opportunity to do just that - import a repository. Warp automatically read the PRD, and got to work on generating the AWK command. Along the way, it checked itself too, which is reassuring. A few minutes later, I had the command and the desired output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, um, that was easy. Suspiciously easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going Deeper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I have run across AWK before, I would never claim to be an expert in its syntax, so I asked Warp to generate a Node.js file that would complete the challenge. Again, a few minutes later, I had what I wanted in a language/syntax with which I was familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reviewing the code, I found it to be complete and comprehensive. It was not quite what I would have written myself, but I appreciated the nod to async/callback processing given the size of the data file. I ran the script and was presented with the same answer as the AWK command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I had clicked a few buttons, and run a few commands - easily toggling between natural language and classic CLI along the way. I had spent about thirty minutes (including the install and sign up), and had set aside an afternoon. Time to ratchet things up a notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Complexity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I really wanted the answer presented by the PRD, then I would import the data file into a database, and use the magic of SQL to dial in an answer. Okay, Warp, generate a Node.js file to put the missions into a SQLite database. And it did. It even installed a modern library to work with SQLite. I ran the script, and moments later had myself a nice little SQLite file. I opened up &lt;a href=&quot;https://tableplus.com/&quot;&gt;TablePlus&lt;/a&gt;, and ran some SQL. Yup, same answer. All systems go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know why, but I chose to write the SQL by hand myself. Old habits die hard? Scared of being confronted with the reality that the tool was killing what took me decades of experience to learn? Denial?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had not hit a roadblock yet with Warp. It had even gone above and beyond in some cases. It is not a real test until you have broken something, so time to get back at it. If I had a database, I figured I might as well take the next step and turn it into an REST API. I wanted to dial up the specificity a bit so I asked Warp to generate a serverless function to be deployed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/&quot;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warp did deliver a serverless function, and that function worked, but it was an older, non-ESM, implementation. It also did not take into consideration any CORS and/or bot handling. I did not ask Warp to do that, so not really a big miss, but it opened the door to push the edge a bit more. Rather than iterate through these changes, I pointed Warp to an example Netlify serverless function I had from another project. Warp adapted seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. This is just too fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I am ultimately looking for a specific answer, not just a data dump, we are going to need some sorting and filtering URL parameters. What say you, Warp? Yeah, no problem. I deployed and hit the API through the browser, added my sort and filter requirements, and just like that I had the same answer staring at me from the first row of the JSON results. Well, I guess the only thing left is a UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Home Sweet UI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent 15 years at Adobe, most of that time spent teaching developers to implement cutting edge user interfaces (with Flash, Flex, and ultimately web standards across devices), user interface development and design is a bit of a sweet spot for me. It feels comfortable. It is the basis of what enabled me to build the generative AI tooling at Amazon. My first role at IBM was actually testing developer SDKs for completeness and idiomatic usage across Android (Java) and iOS (Swift).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svelte 5 makes for an interesting test for generative AI solutions. Svelte 5 was released just around the time of some of the major cut lines LLMs. Features have been added since then some LLMs simply do not know about. Also, I wanted to play with some of those new features myself, so I headed down the Svelte 5 path for this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I implemented the UI myself, again wanting to experience these new features first hand, but I now found myself confidently asking Warp for code snippets whenever needed. Warp had become an ally. The assistance I asked Warp for ranged from building the REST URL dynamically from user interactions, to one-liners around media queries and other markup that I was too lazy to research myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went to build the Svelte project, I needed to change the adapter for my static SPA approach. Warp handled that for me without a problem. &lt;a href=&quot;https://hire-me-warp.netlify.app/&quot;&gt;Check out&lt;/a&gt; the final results. The application is responsive, supports mobile, and includes sorting on columns, as well as status filtering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hire-me-warp.netlify.app/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kevinhoyt.com/img/assets/warp.test.drive.png&quot; alt=&quot;Space Missions&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Was Missing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that I barely touched the full capabilities of Warp. I will be honest, I was expecting it to bomb. It just kept getting better. Hindsight, if I had expected Warp to be this good, I probably would have just written PRDs for the various features I ended up building, and then had it generate the implementation. My experience with other generative AI tooling for developers had taught me that was a bad idea, so I went at the challenge piecemeal. I still got across the finish line, and in record time with a code base I trusted, but it would be an interesting experiment to try PRD-driven development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature I found that I wanted but that was not there is the ability to use local LLMs. There is a lot of really innovative work going on outside the big players. There are features provided by open source LLMs, such as image generation, that I think would really round out the experience. For enterprise or privacy-conscious workflows, such as the generative tooling I made at Amazon, local LLM support would be a game changer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I did not really use the &amp;quot;agentic&amp;quot; aspect of Warp. Warp was fast enough, and complete enough, and accurate enough, and this project was small enough that it never really surfaced as a need. That being said, when I think of agentic workflows as presented by tooling such as n8n, I think there is a lot of room for Warp to expand. Warp sees the input to an agentic workflow as a prompt. There is no reason it could not watch files, directories, support tickets, etc. and get to work without me needing to prompt. Put together with local LLMs and I could see tasks like product image resizing, icon generation, etc. without additional token costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, Warp is a fantastic improvement to my experience with other generative AI tooling. If you are looking to pull your head out of the sand and get acclimated to this new AI-powered future of development, you do not need to look any further than Warp. Personally, I came expecting a terminal replacement with some AI bells and whistles. I left convinced that the future of development is not about AI replacing us - it is about AI working &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; us. Warp gets that balance right.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite aspects of &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/&quot;&gt;Svelte&lt;/a&gt; is that it adds robust data binding to the Web, and then gets out of the way. Do not get me wrong, data binding with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tc39/proposal-observable&quot;&gt;Observable&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy&quot;&gt;Proxy&lt;/a&gt; added to the standard is great. I know that is what Svelte is using under the hood - which makes me happy - but the syntactic sugar afforded by the Svelte compiler is pure joy. Until it is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my applications, &lt;a href=&quot;https://flavorawesome.com/&quot;&gt;Flavor Awesome&lt;/a&gt;, depends heavily on data binding to unknown form elements created at runtime by external metadata. This configuration creates a complex data binding scenario from which I have learned a lot. In this post I will dive deep into some of the more obscure data binding scenarios that I either missed, or that are not covered well, in the Svelte documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Counter Component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When describing data binding (the &lt;code&gt;$state&lt;/code&gt; rune) in a component, the Svelte documentation presents a counter value that is a &lt;code&gt;Number&lt;/code&gt;. When you click an increment button, the counter is incremented by one. The inverse is true for decrementing the count. Svelte then updates the display of the counter in the HTML as it detects the change. It goes something like this…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; decrease &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;$lib/assets/arrow-down.svg&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; increase &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;$lib/assets/arrow-up.svg&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;$state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onDecreaseClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onIncreaseClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;article&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;button 
    aria&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Decrease&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 
    disabled&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 
    onclick&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;onDecreaseClick&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 
    type&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;button&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;img alt&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Arrow pointing down&quot;&lt;/span&gt; src&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;decrease&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;count&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;button 
    aria&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Increase&quot;&lt;/span&gt; 
    onclick&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;onIncreaseClick&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 
    type&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;button&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;img alt&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Arrow pointing up&quot;&lt;/span&gt; src&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;increase&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;article&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! Wow! Data binding with Svelte is magical and easy to use. If you want to seed the counter value from outside of the component, you remove the &lt;code&gt;$state&lt;/code&gt; rune, and replace it with a property value (&lt;code&gt;$props&lt;/code&gt;). This is defined as such...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;$props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you change the counter value inside the component, that change happens only inside the component itself. If you want the change to bubble up, then you need to add an event listener to the component. When the counter is changed inside the component, you make the change, and then call the event listener, passing the new counter value as an argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; onchange&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;$props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onDecreaseClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; onchange &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onchange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onIncreaseClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; onchange &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onchange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are binding the counter value to the component, then you do not even need to make the change to the counter in the component itself. When the change is made to the counter value outside of the component, it will be updated inside the component as well. Data binding magic once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Counter As A Property&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been brief in this review of Svelte data binding because it is covered well in the documentation. If you need more detail, I would suggest heading over to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://svelte.dev/playground/component-bindings&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; to brush up before continuing with this post. Here is the catch: What happens when the counter is not a &lt;code&gt;Number&lt;/code&gt; value, but rather a &lt;code&gt;Number&lt;/code&gt; property on a custom &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;? This is where things get interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be inclined to perform the same operations, but on the relevant property. Something like...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// This will cause an error&lt;/span&gt;
item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you do this, you will get an error from Svelte. The error is displayed as &lt;code&gt;ownership_invalid_mutation&lt;/code&gt;. A description of the problem is provided with the error, and you can go down a rabbit hole trying to understand it. I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you have to think of &lt;code&gt;$state&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$props&lt;/code&gt; as different things. The &lt;code&gt;$state&lt;/code&gt; rune will monitor property changes. A component property (&lt;code&gt;$props&lt;/code&gt;) is a snapshot of the value being passed into the component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, when you make a change to the value of a component property, and that value is a primitive such as &lt;code&gt;Number&lt;/code&gt;, then you will not get the error. When the value being passed to the component is an &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; however, and then you change a property of that &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;, Svelte is telling you that the component does not own the original &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;. More specifically, it is saying that the property changes on the &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; will not be applied because unlike &lt;code&gt;$state&lt;/code&gt;, the component property is a snapshot, not a state value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Updating the Property&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have two choices in this scenario. This first is to use the event listener to bubble up the changed value. That change then gets applied at the level where it is owned (&lt;code&gt;$state&lt;/code&gt;), and the subsequent data bindings are updated in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;$state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onDecreaseClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; onchange &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onchange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the complexity of your components, this works great. If your components are heavily nested, then you may have to bubble up the change repeatedly until the change gets to a place where the owner (&lt;code&gt;$state&lt;/code&gt;) can be modified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Flavor Awesome, the form fields are components, and they live inside a form component. That form component tracks changes on the source &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;, but that &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; is itself a component property. Because I am using metadata to define the form, the &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; properties may be different. The form component is also responsible for validation before bubbling up the modified &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; when the changes are committed. Using the bubbling approach then creates an event listener mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onDecreaseClick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; item &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    item &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; count&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; onchange &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;onchange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; item &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second option is to modify the property of the &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; at the form level, and then have the changes updated through data binding. When the form is filled out, and validated, the modified &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; is then bubbled. As we have just seen however, modifying an &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; property will result in an error because the form component does not own the original &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick here is to replace the &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; property &lt;strong&gt;in its entirety&lt;/strong&gt; at the form level through Object destructuring. This will trigger data binding at the form level, and update the form field component appropriately. We are effectively working on the snapshot of the &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; until it is ready to be bubbled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On Snapshots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the bubbled changes reach the owner, and you have made changes to the original &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;, you may want to use &lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt; to verify the contents before you write the code to commit the changes. If you use &lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt; on the owning object you will get a different Svelte error that reads &lt;code&gt;console_log_state&lt;/code&gt;. This error is presented because you are logging the &lt;code&gt;Proxy&lt;/code&gt; object that holds the &lt;code&gt;$state&lt;/code&gt; value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; $state&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;snapshot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; item &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the &lt;code&gt;$state&lt;/code&gt; rune has a &lt;code&gt;snapshot()&lt;/code&gt; method you can use to get a copy of the &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; itself at that point in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;$state.snapshot()&lt;/code&gt; method is useful in other scenarios as well. Flavor Awesome uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API&quot;&gt;IndexedDB&lt;/a&gt; to manage data locally in the browser. You can put a &lt;code&gt;$state&lt;/code&gt; value into IndexedDB collection, but what you will be storing is the &lt;code&gt;Proxy&lt;/code&gt; object, not the value of the &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; that &lt;code&gt;Proxy&lt;/code&gt; is watching. What we want is the actual &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; value. Here, you can use the &lt;code&gt;$state.snapshot()&lt;/code&gt; method to get that original &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; before you insert it into the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data binding with Svelte is very powerful. As Uncle Ben says though &amp;quot;With great power comes great responsibility.&amp;quot; Understanding the data on which you are operating becomes a very important aspect of developing with Svelte. Hopefully this post has shed some light on the deeper nuances of that process - especially as it relates to components. If you want to play with the concepts further, the code for this post is available as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/krhoyt/609e2f6b950355e9b051dc1904534cbb&quot;&gt;GitHub Gist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Getting Comfortable with Circles</title>
      <link href="https://kevinhoyt.com/blog/2025/07/15/comfort-w-circles/"/>
      <updated>2025-07-15T00:00:00Z</updated>

      <summary>When is the last time you installed a module or library because you thought the task was too hard (or time consuming) to tackle yourself?

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When is the last time you installed a module or library because you thought the task was too hard (or time consuming) to tackle yourself? On the front end, this scenario can quickly lead to a resulting application that is considerably larger than it needs to be. You might be surprised to discover that some of the tasks that you might think of as hard, such as charts, animation, and date handling, can actually be pretty straightforward - and have a big impact on the size and performance of your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is the first in a series that delves into some of those areas that cause most developers to reach for a third-party library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take for example the humble circle. Sure, you took trigonometry at some point in the past, but who remembers the implications of all those sine, cosine, tangent, and hypotenuse calculations? I mean, where in my brain am I going to put the Marvel Cinematic Universe story arcs if I do not make some space up there? And then along comes a radar chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kevinhoyt.com/img/assets/radar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Radar chart&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the rest of this post, we will tackle building this radar chart from scratch. Along the way you will pick up a handful of lines of math that make it all possible; opening the door to building your own custom charts that are light-weight and blazing fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Radar Chart Deconstructed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we jump into the code, let us take a moment to look at the radar chart above. Calm down. Center yourself. What are the parts that make up the chart? There are clearly some labels around the outside of the chart. The chart itself is a circle, which means a specific radius. This chart has nested circles. There are five circles in total, and five labels (though the number of circles and labels are unrelated). It also looks like there are two datasets being plotted, each with a different color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is where we will start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;COLORS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;#1f78b4&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;#46a040&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;LABELS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Power tools&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Electrical supplies&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Plumbing items&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Garden tools&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Plants&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;LEVELS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;RADIUS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;150&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;STEPS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;RADIUS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;LEVELS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;SVGNS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;    

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; data &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;900&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;900&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;900&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;900&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;650&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    maximum &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;d&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;v&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; maximum &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;d&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;v&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; maximum&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// SVG elements&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; svg &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;svg&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; chart &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;g&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have manually extrapolated the data represented in the chart - an &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; with one &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; each for the data being plotted. Each of those &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; have five data points. There are five elements in the &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; because there are five labels, not because there are five circles. I have also found the maximum value in the dataset. Sometimes you may also need to find the minimum, but it is clear from the picture that zero is the minimum in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have also noticed the &lt;code&gt;SVGNS&lt;/code&gt; variable with a URL as the value. We will be using SVG to render our chart, and some SVG DOM operations require the SVG namespace, so this variable is there simply for brevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;svg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;300&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;300&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;svg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SVG element gets a default size in the DOM, and we will be playing with that a little later. For now, I set a &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;300&lt;/code&gt; just to give us some space while we are working. The &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; or &amp;quot;group&amp;quot; element is what will hold all the elements we generate to create our chart. The group element is your friend when working with SVG. It opens the door for more targetted transformations, which again, we will get to later. While we are here, the last two lines of the JavaScript code snippet above, grabs references to each of the two main SVG element from the DOM. We will use these both pretty extensively moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Circles Everywhere&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a good description of our radar chart, let us get to the drawing. We will start with those five nested circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Circles&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;LEVELS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; circle &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createElementNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;SVGNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;circle&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  circle&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setAttributeNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;r&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; steps &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  chart&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; circle &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop here is setup to start at one, and then iterate five times (&lt;code&gt;LEVELS === 5&lt;/code&gt;). Why not set the iterator to zero, and then go until &lt;code&gt;c &amp;lt; LEVELS&lt;/code&gt; like most loops? That would give us five circles, but the first circle would have a radius of zero. The result would appear to be only four circles. We want five circles, with the zero radius circle at the center implied. That means we need to shift our loop by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will notice that we are not worrying about the positioning of the circles. We create the circles and put them into the DOM. The default center will be zero on both the X and Y axes. This is the top-left corner of the SVG element, and makes the math easier moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The View Box&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run this code now, you will see only the bottom-right quadrant of the circles. We could calculate the center position, and set the coordinates of the circles, but SVG offers us a way to independantly control what part of the SVG content is visible. This parameter is called &lt;code&gt;viewBox&lt;/code&gt; and is set on the SVG element itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;svg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;300&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;300&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;viewBox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;-150 -150 300 300&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;svg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outside circle has a radius of 150 pixels. That is a diameter of 300 pixels. If the center of the circle is at &lt;code&gt;0, 0&lt;/code&gt; then 150 pixels of that circle are off the view of the SVG element, effectively placing the left-most pixel at -150 pixels. We can tell the SVG element about this with &lt;code&gt;viewBox&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;viewBox&lt;/code&gt; attribute takes four arguments - the left, top, width, and height of the viewport we would like to designate. By telling the &lt;code&gt;viewBox&lt;/code&gt; that the left and top are -150, and that there is a width and height of 300, then we will see the full set of circles, not just the bottom-right quadrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In advanced manipulations of &lt;code&gt;viewBox&lt;/code&gt; you may need to calculate ratios of the content to be displayed relative to the dimensions of the SVG element itself. This is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but I will pick it up in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Radians and Degrees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five spokes on the radar chart are set at an equal number of degrees apart. There are fives spokes (one for each label). Each spoke starts at 0, 0 and goes to a point on the outer circle some number of degrees separated from the previous spoke. We need to know what the X and Y coordinates are for those points. Okay, here comes the circle math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Radians&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;degreesToRadians&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;degrees&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; degrees &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;PI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;180&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Degrees make sense to you and I. For example, we can think of 360 degrees in a circle. The trigonometric functions we will work with do not want degrees as an argument, they want radians. Why radians? What exactly is a radian? In drawing circles and lines, we do not really care. Sure, there is a perfectly reasonable maths explaination, but we do not care. All we care about is that we convert our degrees to the radian unit desired when working with these functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Spokes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; s &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; s &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;LABELS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; s&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; angle &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;degreesToRadians&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;360&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;LABELS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; s &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;90&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;RADIUS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;cos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; angle &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; y &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;RADIUS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; angle &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; path &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createElementNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;SVGNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;path&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  path&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;classList&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;spoke&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  path&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setAttributeNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;d&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;M 0 0 L &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;x&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;y&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  chart&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; path &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for each of the labels we will draw a &amp;quot;spoke&amp;quot;. The angle of that spoke is based on the index of the iteration. To get the X-coordinate we use &lt;code&gt;Math.cos( angle )&lt;/code&gt; of the angle we are interested in getting. We multiply by the &lt;code&gt;RADIUS&lt;/code&gt; of the outer circle to project out along that angle to the point where the line will intercept the circle. To get the Y-coordinate we do the same thing, but use &lt;code&gt;Math.sin( angle )&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is it. That is all the circle math you need to know - use radians, &lt;code&gt;Math.cos()&lt;/code&gt; is the X-coordinate, and &lt;code&gt;Math.sin()&lt;/code&gt; is the Y-coordinate. If you have those three rules in your head, you can have all kinds of fun with circle math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In SVG, a spoke will be represented as a &lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; element. The &lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; element takes a series of numbers and letters that indicate a description (&lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; attribute) of what is to be drawn. You can go down a rabbit hole with this, but we will stick to &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; for &amp;quot;move to&amp;quot; and &lt;code&gt;L&lt;/code&gt; for &amp;quot;line to&amp;quot;. Each value is followed by an X and Y-coordinate respectively. To draw a spoke, we describe the line as &amp;quot;move to 0, 0 and then draw a line to X and Y&amp;quot; and determined by the circle math we just performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plotting the Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To plot the data, we use the exact same rules as the spokes - radians, &lt;code&gt;Math.cos()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Math.sin()&lt;/code&gt;. Indeed the iteration of the dataset starts off with pretty much the same code as from the spokes. The only subtle difference is that we are not going to multiply by &lt;code&gt;RADIUS&lt;/code&gt; because that would always be 150 pixels. We want the plot of the data to reflect the values in the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Map range&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; in_min&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; in_max&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; out_min&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; out_max&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; ratio &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; value &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; in_min &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; in_max &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; in_min &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; out_min &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; ratio &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; out_max &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; out_min &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;      
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, when we setup the description of the radar chart, we determined the maximum value in the dataset. In this case, that is 900. The radius of the circle is only 150 pixels. Drawing a plot line at 900 pixels would not even show up on our 300x300 SVG element. We need to map the dataset value relative to the radius of the circle. The map function here takes a value, the range in which that value falls, and target range to which we want to relate. In this case, 900 becomes 150. A value of 450 would become 75, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually picked up this algorithm when working with microcontrollers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Data &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first iteration of each of the two datasets, we do not want to move to 0, 0 before drawing. We want to move to the first coordinate of the relative/mapped value. We only want that move to happen on the first iteration (index of zero). After that we want to draw a line to the relative/mapped coordinate. When we have finished a set of iterations for a dataset, we want to close the plot. We could calculate this and draw another line, but SVG gives us the &lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; command which tells the path to close itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set the &lt;code&gt;stroke&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; representing the dataset on the element directly as the colors change. For the &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; specifically, I take the six-digit hexadecimal value, and append &lt;code&gt;40&lt;/code&gt; to it, representing an alpha channel value (opacity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Label the Values&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in the home stretch now! The radar chart example that we are referencing, displays values on the vertical axis. You might be inclined to reach for our three rules again - radians, &lt;code&gt;Math.cos()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Math.sin()&lt;/code&gt; - but we already know the X-coordinate is zero (plus some pixels for spacing). All we need is the Y-coordinate where each of the circles intersects the vertical axis line, and the relative value that represents within the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Values&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use the SVG &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; element to display the values. Note that the &lt;code&gt;textContent&lt;/code&gt; property is where we assign the text to be displayed (not &lt;code&gt;innerText&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Label the Labels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for those labels along the outside of the chart itself. Here we will use our three rules again - radians, &lt;code&gt;Math.cos()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Math.sin()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Labels&lt;/span&gt;

  text&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setAttributeNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;x&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  text&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setAttributeNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;y&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; y &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  chart&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; text &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;      
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;16&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt; might seem like &amp;quot;magic numbers&amp;quot;. These numbers are manually adjusted to keep the labels from bumping right up against the outer circle. Custom visual spacing tweak for the win!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; element will render the content using the top-left corner by default. That is to say that if the placement coordinates are 160, 130, that is where the top-left corner of the text content will be located. The result is that the content will render out across the chart contents itself. Fortunately, you can tell &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; what to use as an origin with the &lt;code&gt;dominant-baseline&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;text-anchor&lt;/code&gt; properties (representing vertical and horizontal respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, for the first value, the label at the top of the chart, we want an origin of bottom-center. At 90 degrees along, we want an origin of center-left. When we get to the other side of the circle, say at 270 degrees, we want an origin of center-right. I have not found a clean, mathematical way to calculate this placement, so I use the degrees of the placement in an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Label placement&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;placement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;index&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; degrees &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;360&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; index&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;code&gt;placement&lt;/code&gt; function is like the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; function in that it does not really change. It is a utility you can put aside and reference over and over again whenever you are build circle charts. If you have found a better approach, I would love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One More Thing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the hard parts of constructing and rendering our chart are complete. Unfortunately, some of the labels along the outside of the chart, especially the long one on the right, are being truncated by our SVG element dimensions. What we really want now is to take into consideration not just &lt;code&gt;RADIUS&lt;/code&gt;, which is where we got our &lt;code&gt;viewBox&lt;/code&gt; from initially, but also the new dimensions of the entire chart to include the labels; however long they may be. With those dimensions, we then want to adjust the &lt;code&gt;viewBox&lt;/code&gt; to display all the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; bounds &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; chart&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getBBox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
svg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;setAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;viewBox&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;bounds&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;x&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;bounds&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;y&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;bounds&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;width&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;bounds&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;height&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be familiar with &lt;code&gt;getBoundingClientRect()&lt;/code&gt;. We could use that here as well, but SVG elements actually give us &lt;code&gt;getBBox()&lt;/code&gt; which returns values designed to placed in the &lt;code&gt;viewBox&lt;/code&gt;. We make a call to &lt;code&gt;getBBox()&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;code&gt;chart&lt;/code&gt;, and then set the &lt;code&gt;viewBox&lt;/code&gt; accordingly. Now the entire chart, including the labels, will be displayed in the viewport of the SVG element. This holds true even if you resize the SVG element - for example, if you had a &lt;code&gt;grid&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;flex&lt;/code&gt; display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whew! That seems like a lot, right? I mean, at this point you might be thinking &amp;quot;I will just use the library, thanks.&amp;quot; And I get it. It is a lot... Of learning. The actual code is not even 200 lines of JavaScript. It is blazing fast, and because you wrote it, and understand the core principles, you can customize it to your heart&#39;s content. When a VP decides that they want a change on how things are displayed, you do not have to check and see if your library supports that customization. Now you can make the change directly yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here you might consider wrapping this up in a Web Component, and exposing some basic customization through CSS properties. Happy charting!&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If there is one &amp;quot;soft&amp;quot; skill that has served me the best during my two decades in Information Technology, it has to be time management. There are many approaches to time management. Entire systems have evolved to help. One of these is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity-ebook/dp/B00KWG9M2E/ref=sr_1_1?crid=8JR6JESZYA3E&amp;amp;keywords=getting+things+done&amp;amp;qid=1672181613&amp;amp;sprefix=getting+things+done%2Caps%2C214&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/a&gt;, or GTD, based on the book of the same name by author, David Allen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get as involved in GTD as you want. This is not that kind of post. This is a post about the decision making process at the core of GTD that you can use right now, without changing a single thing about how you work. This is GTD distilled down to the very core - do it, defer it, delegate it, drop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Primer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the core concepts in GTD is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; keeping information in your head. Keeping information in your head represents a cognitive load that slows you down, and will keep you awake at night. Our brains are horrible at tracking the myriad details that come with our lives in the modern era. The important information that should be in your head relates to your profession, not to the processes of the details that surround it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When new work arrives at your desk, in whatever form it may arrive, you have a decision to make. The decision is seemingly simple, yet we quickly arrive at analysis paralysis. Your email backs up. You start dropping important tasks. Missing opportunities. This is exactly because we are trying to keep all these details in our heads. To resolve this problem, GTD provides a decision matrix consisting of four simple categories - do it, defer it, delegate it, drop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When new work arrives at your desk, first ask yourself &amp;quot;Do I have time to address this right now?&amp;quot; If you do have the time, then do the work. Get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you do the work, I suggest putting the time you spent into a calendar. Over time this collection of work that you completed will give you a better picture of how you work, and the type of work you deal with most frequently. I even color-code the blocks of time in my calendar. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defer It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When new work arrives at your desk, if you do not have the time to &amp;quot;do it&amp;quot; then defer it until later. You accomplish this once again by heading to your calendar. Estimate the time that the work will take, and find a place for it on your calendar. Block off that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the time comes around again, be true to yourself, and do the work. If something else has come up, then move the block to a time when you can take care of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also of importance is the details of the work to be done. I load my calendar blocks with all the pertinent details that relate to that piece of work. In this manner, when I come to the task at some point in the future, I do not have to spend time digging up the references and refreshing the information in my brain. If the information I need is in the calendar block, then I am immediately brought up to speed on what it is exactly that I need to do. Deciding what is pertinent can require some experience to refine. When in doubt, put everything you think might be related into the appointment block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Delegate It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When new work arrives at your desk, it may not be work for you to do at all. Sometimes somebody else can take the work entirely, or at the very least, may need to take action on the work before you can proceed. When work of this nature arrives at your desk, you delegate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes with a caveat. While you may be master your time management, that does not mean that others are doing the same. They may still be trying to run everything out of their brains. They may be dropping things along the way. To account for this, turn once again to your calendar, and decide on a time to follow-up on the work. Block off time in your calendar to circle back on the progress with the person to whom the work was delegated. And again, be sure to put all the details in the calendar block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the time in your calendar comes back around in the future, you can follow-up with the pertinent individual. If they are not done with the work yet, then schedule an additional follow-up time in the future. In this manner, you transfer the cognitive load to somebody else until it is time for you to actually do the work. When the work is ready for you, then block off time in the calendar to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drop It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When new work arrives at your desk, there are times when you do not really need to do that work at all. Or there could be old work that you deferred or delegated that you no longer need to do. This is a moment for brutal honesty. Is this work something you really need to do? If the answer to that question is &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; then drop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as with deciding what information to put in your &amp;quot;do it&amp;quot; calendar blocks, this also takes some experience to get right. As you settle more into using the decision matrix, you will find that since the cognitive load is less, that the decisions become easier. That the decision becomes more clear. You may find that there was a significant amount of work you used to think was important, but that it was really just stuck in analysis paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally tend to be pretty heavy handed with &amp;quot;drop it&amp;quot; work. There is a lot of noise in the modern workflow. Dropping the work that is not actually important clears up the signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the work may not be important now, sometimes it becomes important later. For this reason, it it important to have a reliable archive system in place. This can take a number of forms. Depending on how often your email gets archived, filing the work away may be a good option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found that email archive and search is not particularly robust or reliable, so I create Markdown documents for work that may become important in the future. These generally take the form of &amp;quot;YYYY-MM-DD-work-label.md&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Color Coding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color coding your blocks of time can be a helpful tool. In one glance, you can quickly get an idea of where you are spending your time, and how your might choose to optimize. When I am traveling, I expect to see large blocks of time dedicated to getting to the airport, sitting on a plane, and getting to my destination. When I am ramping up for a major deadline, I expect to see large blocks of time dedicated to doing work. If I do not see these colors, then I know I am missing something, or that I am not appropriately aligned with the work that needs to get done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The labels I currently use for these colors are defined by where I work, Amazon. Amazon has a robust set of Leadership Principles (LP) that are infused across the company. You rarely go a day without hearing an LP. My labels are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coaching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connecting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delivering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Travel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These labels have changed over time, and continue to do so. This reflects the changing nature of my work, the nature of my role, or the employer for which I work. These labels may not work for you, but hopefully they are a good guide to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I had color codes and labels, I set out with blocking time using the decision matrix. After a month, I looked back at the time blocks and decided general categories that I saw surfacing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do it. Defer it. Delegate it. Drop it. The &amp;quot;Four D&amp;quot; system of time management thanks to a heavily distilled Getting Things Done. This requires no new tools. Only a calendar, and the occasional Markdown file are needed. You do not need to subscribe to some new service. You do not need to memorize shorthand symbols. You just put time on your calendar, and stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done effectively, with practice, people will begin to wonder just how it is that you get so much work done. You will be &amp;quot;that person&amp;quot; that always seems to be a step ahead of the curve. Meanwhile your cognitive load has declined significantly, you sleep better, your do not miss opportunities, and you generally feel less stressed. If that sounds good, then I encourage you to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

      <updated>2022-12-02T00:00:00Z</updated>

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services (AWS) has so many services. A stroll through the catalog will likely yield something useful for just about any project. Sometimes our projects pick us. This week a customer asked for an example of using &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/&quot;&gt;AWS Transcribe&lt;/a&gt; with Python. Having used other transcription services, I could not pass up the challenge. What follows is my approach to implementing a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a little setup required to get all this going. I have tried to stick to the absolute minimum amount of setup. While walking through each of these setup steps is beyond the scope of this post, I will give you some pointers along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Access and Identity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use AWS, you will obviously need an account. With your account in hand, you can get the credentials you will need to access the AWS services. The danger with doing this is that if you are using the root account credentials, then those credentials have access to everything in your account. If you let those credentials slip into malicious hands - say, by accidentally committing them to a public GitHub account - then those hands can really cause you a lot of pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than use the root account credentials directly, I recommend heading over to the Identity Management (IAM) service and creating a group with specific permissions for the services you will be using. In this case, those permissions are &amp;quot;Transcribe&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;S3&amp;quot;. Then create a user and generate credentials for that user. Finally, assign that user to the group that has the appropriate permissions. Now should those credentials fall into malicious hands, the only access they have is to those services specified for the group. If you suspect malicious activity, you can log into the root account and disable the user and/or group with a few clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;S3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to provide the audio file for Transcribe to use, you will need a place in AWS to put that file; namely an S3 bucket. If you already have an S3 Bucket setup, you can use that, or even create a folder inside of that bucket if you do not want your Transcribe content to co-mingle with other content you may have in the bucket. However you go about it, note the region in which the bucket resides. You will need this piece of information to use both Transcribe and S3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Python&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few moving pieces on the Python side of this solution. The first is a file to put your environment variables. What environment variables? Namely, those all so precious access keys. You want to avoid putting those access keys directly into your Python code (or any language you may be using). There are also some other variables that are used throughout this solution that go nicely into that environment file. In a file named &lt;code&gt;transcribe.env&lt;/code&gt; I have placed the following variable details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;AWS_ACCESS_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;_YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_
&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;AWS_SECRET_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_
&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;AWS_REGION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;_S3_REGION_
&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;LOCAL_AUDIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;hello-world.m4a
&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;S3_BUCKET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;_S3_BUCKET_NAME_
&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;S3_OBJECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;_PATH_TO_AUDIO_IN_BUCKET_
&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;SLEEP_TIME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;TRANSCRIPTION_JOB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;hello-world&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will talk about these environment variables in more detail as we get into the specific Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, you will need to install two Python libraries. Again, I have tried to keep this pretty minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html&quot;&gt;Boto3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the AWS library for Python. While AWS is mostly REST under the covers, trying to manage the headers and structure of the requests yourself can be very overwhelming. While I am not a fan of adding libraries for the sake of adding libraries, this is one case where it absolutely makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/&quot;&gt;DotEnv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: You have externalized key pieces of data into an environment variable file. That is great! Now we need a way to pull them into our main logic, parse them, and make use of them. Like anything Python, there are a dozen ways to do this, but I find this little helper worth the value to have along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing libraries will look something like &lt;code&gt;pip install boto3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything else used in this solution is a part of the standard Python runtime. Oh, and it is worth mentioning that this is all Python 3 code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ready, Set...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solution uses a variety of libraries, both third-party as mentioned above, and from the Python runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; boto3
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; io
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; json
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; os
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; sys
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; time

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; dotenv &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; load_dotenv
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; pathlib &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Path&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;boto3&lt;/strong&gt;: As previously mentioned, this is the Python AWS library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;io&lt;/strong&gt;: Allows reading the Transcribe results directly into memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;json&lt;/strong&gt;: Provides a means to parse and read the JSON data that often results from interacting with AWS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;os&lt;/strong&gt;: Used for access the environment variables once read and parsed by the supporting &lt;code&gt;dotenv&lt;/code&gt; library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sys&lt;/strong&gt;: Access to command-line arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;time&lt;/strong&gt;: Can pause execution while we poll the Transcribe service to see if it has completed its work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;from dotenv import load_dotenv&lt;/strong&gt;: Reads and parses the environment variable file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;from pathlib import Path&lt;/strong&gt;: Helps specify where the environment variable file lives on the local file system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Go!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first lines of code should be to read and parse the environment variables file so they can be used throughout the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;dotenv_path &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Path&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;transcribe.env&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
load_dotenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; dotenv_path &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Path&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;transcribe.env&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To access an AWS service, we must for instantiate a &amp;quot;client&amp;quot; for services we want to access. Client instantiation includes parameters specific to that service. We will need two clients since we are accessing two different services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;storage &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; boto3&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;client&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;s3&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Audio File&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS Transcribe works from an audio file placed on S3. Here we will check S3 to see if our desired audio file already exists. If it does not, we will upload an audio file from the local file system to S3 for later use by Transcribe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Transcribe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to tell AWS Transcribe to work on a specific audio file, we create a &amp;quot;job&amp;quot;. That job is asynchronous. That is to say that when we make the call to create a job, that call will kick off the job and return. It will not hold up execution of the logic while waiting for the job to complete. In order to find out if the job has completed, we will need to repeatedly ask Transcribe about the status of the job (polling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many parts of &lt;code&gt;Boto3&lt;/code&gt; include &lt;code&gt;waiters&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Waiters&lt;/code&gt; are a means of &lt;em&gt;waiting&lt;/em&gt; for the work on AWS to complete. Transcribe does not support &lt;code&gt;waiters&lt;/code&gt; at this time, so polling it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;completed &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;
    
  time&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;sleep&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;SLEEP_TIME&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a lot to take in at once. Let us review what is going on in the above snippet. First, we create a variable to track if the job is complete. Since it is not complete when we first create the job, the value of &lt;code&gt;completed&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we ask Transcribe for the status of the job. The job may not exist yet. If the job does not exist, we start a new job using the &lt;code&gt;start_transcription_job()&lt;/code&gt; function call. Among the parameters passed to the &lt;code&gt;start_transcription_job()&lt;/code&gt; includes the path to our audio file sitting on S3. Also specified is the path where Transcribe should place the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, after either of those calls are made, we check the progress in the resulting JSON dictionary. There are different values that might come back from checking on the job status. One of those might be an error. Another might be a failure to transcribe the content. In either of those cases, as well as in the case of the status being &lt;code&gt;COMPLETE&lt;/code&gt; we want to stop polling and move on to the next phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, is to continue checking on the job status - polling. We do not want to poll too aggressively here (DDoS), so we pause execution of the logic for a few seconds before checking again. The time that Transcribe will take to complete the job depends on the size of the audio file. Eventually the job will complete. Transcribe will then place the JSON formatted results in the bucket we specified when we started the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of this solution, we want to download the Transcribe results JSON file, and place it on the local file system so we can open it up with a text editor and learn about the various pieces of data that are included with the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;dir_index &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;S3_OBJECT&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;index&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
file_name &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;S3_OBJECT&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;dir_index&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;.json&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
storage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;download_file&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  Filename &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; file_name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  Bucket &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;S3_BUCKET&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  Key &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;S3_OBJECT&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;.json&quot;&lt;/span&gt;      
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; file_name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;r&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; local_file&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  response &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; json&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;load&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; local_file &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; response&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;results&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;transcripts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;transcript&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;code&gt;S3_OBJECT&lt;/code&gt; environment variable includes some path information (&amp;quot;transcribe&amp;quot;). If we keep this as-is, then the download from S3 will try to put the results into a &amp;quot;transcribe&amp;quot; folder in our project on the local file system. I just want to put the results in the same folder as the Python program itself, so I take a few steps to parse out the file name from the rest of the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heading over to our S3 client instance, we then download the file. We can then open the file, and read the contents as JSON data, yielding a Python dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Gist, I also include a version of downloading the results file from S3, directly into memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any given transcription, there may be multiple results. I good next step might be to dig deeper into the results to determine the confidence of the various transcriptions, and then select a specific result. In this case, I am getting, and displaying, the first result only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cleanup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solution takes into account that you may want to reuse the audio file on S3, or just plain keep it around for archival purposes. If you have no intention of reusing any of the associated parts and pieces of the process, it is a good idea to clean up after ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;-c&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; sys&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;argv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  transcribe&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;delete_transcription_job&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    TranscriptionJobName &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;TRANSCRIPTION_JOB&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  
  response &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; storage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;delete_object&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    Bucket &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;S3_BUCKET&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    Key &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; os&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getenv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;S3_OBJECT&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To account for this, you can add a command-line argument of &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt; when you run the Python program. There is no significance to the &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt;. It is made up by me. The &amp;quot;c&amp;quot; stands for &amp;quot;cleanup&amp;quot;. If the &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt; argument is included, we delete the Transcribe job, and then delete the audio file from S3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All said and done, this solution is a little over 100 lines of code. Depending on how you fit this solution into your project, those lines of code could be much less or much more. This really all depends on how robust you need the code to be. Thanks to judicious use of the &lt;code&gt;boto3&lt;/code&gt; library however, you are on your way to using AWS Transcribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I absolutely appreciate these types of questions from AWS customers, and hope this example serves to answer questions around using AWS Transcribe with Python. For reference, I have placed the environment variable file (with security-specific values redacted), and the entirety of the Python program in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/krhoyt/46a8fac60cb25c44eaad9447e4c4685a&quot;&gt;GitHub Gist&lt;/a&gt; for your reference. Or copy and paste. Whatever. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Three P Weekly Status Report</title>
      <link href="https://kevinhoyt.com/blog/2022/06/15/three-p/"/>
      <updated>2022-06-15T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <id>https://kevinhoyt.com/blog/2022/06/15/three-p/</id>

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What did you do last week? Not down to the minute, but what were the high-level themes of the work you did last week? This is not a trick question, and should be relatively easy to answer. Got it? Cool! Now, what did you do 24 weeks ago (six months)? Is that a little harder to answer? A lot harder? Okay, well, here comes the annual review; are you ready? Or are you going to spend countless hours digging through material to try and justify your existence to the business?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ug! This is all such a drag. All I really want to do is code/write/anything else!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the many techniques I use to solve this problem is what I call the &amp;quot;Three P&amp;quot; weekly status report. Why &amp;quot;Three P&amp;quot;? Because there are three parts to it: progress, priorities, and problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress:&lt;/strong&gt; Details about the work you completed over the last week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Priorities:&lt;/strong&gt; Work you intend to accomplish in the week ahead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problems:&lt;/strong&gt; Issues that are slowing you down or preventing progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The First Report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a week, generally on Monday or Friday, create a new markdown document. Save the file using a name consisting of the current ISO 8601 formatted date, followed by a dash, followed by the word &amp;quot;status&amp;quot; and then the &lt;code&gt;md&lt;/code&gt; markdown extension. This results in a file name along the lines of &lt;code&gt;2022-06-06-status.md&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;June 6, 2022&lt;/code&gt;. It does not matter that you use this suggested formatting approach. Whatever you choose - you must be consistent. I use the ISO 8601 approach because it makes the status report files easily sortable whether you are using a command line or GUI finder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our report file created, break out the three sections of progress, priorities, and problems. I generally use an &lt;code&gt;H2&lt;/code&gt; heading for the sections. Using an &lt;code&gt;H2&lt;/code&gt; provides the flexibility of using an &lt;code&gt;H1&lt;/code&gt; for the title should the report need one. An example of where a title might be included is when you spend all week dedicated to a significant event for the company (e.g. AWS re:Invent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-md&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-md&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token title important&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;##&lt;/span&gt; Progress&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token title important&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;##&lt;/span&gt; Problems&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token list punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Access to production database
&lt;span class=&quot;token list punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Plane was delayed - avoid ORD ✈️
&lt;span class=&quot;token list punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Did not get adequate sleep&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Progress&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, review the work you did over the last week and try to summarize it into three-to-five items. Sometimes there are more items that you may want to call out - sometimes many more - and that is fine. Add what you need. Want to embellish? Add a link to a bug you fixed? Great! Markdown is there for you. Have fun. This is &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; status report after all. The point here is not to detail every waking minute, the point is to record a general sense of how you spent the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you stop for a moment, take a breath, and think about what you accomplished this past week, certain items will likely surface in your mind. These items, and potentially the items related to those items, are what you are trying to capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be natural. You have nobody to impress here but yourself. This is not the place for self-aggrandizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Priorities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With last week in the mirror, take another breath. What are you looking to accomplish in the week ahead? Again, this is relatively high-level with three-to-five bullets (more if you need it). While you should never retroactively go back and change these items once you have finished the report and started the week, these items do not necessarily need to reflect the actual outcome of the week. It is totally acceptable to not complete your priority items - or to end up doing more than you anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, in this space, you are trying to capture your intentions. Nobody is going to harass you about what you did not do except for yourself - which is kind of the point, and one of the interesting side-effects of this approach to capturing your work. You may start out the week with one set of intentions, only to find that events took an unexpected twist along the way. Looking back on your reports will show that course clearly, which is exactly the type of detail we want to capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Problems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally there are the problems you are currently experiencing that are preventing you from doing something you want. You may not have problems every week, and that is fine. Over the years of using this technique, I will frequently list the problems that are going on outside of work, that impact my productivity while at work. Perhaps the &amp;quot;check engine&amp;quot; light came on in my car, and trying to schedule everything to get it fixed is decreasing my productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is okay to have fun. Use emojis where they fit the context to capture that extra little bit of emotion around the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Second Report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the second week rolls around, and you set aside time to write your second weekly report, the process starts pretty much the same as before. New file, new date, the three parts. Now open the report from the previous week. See those &amp;quot;priorities&amp;quot; you listed? At least some of those are likely &amp;quot;progress&amp;quot; items now, so move them on over to the new report. Congratulations! You are on your way to status report legend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Magic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you are taking fifteen minutes, once per week, to put together a weekly status report. A few weeks go by, and you look back at some of the reports. You will start to see the the evolution from problem, to priority, to progress. This becomes even more pronounced with time. It feels very rewarding to see the progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to schedule time on my calendar to do my weekly status report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, when annual review time comes around, you will have a months (year) long trail of all the work you have done. Reviewing your weekly status reports, you extract the more important points that map to your goals. A little polishing to form a cohesive narrative, and you are done. This time the annual review was not a pain, but actually a kind of enjoyable trip down memory lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Scale&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This useful technique may seem like a nice-to-have at the individual level, but it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; starts to shine when it involves a whole team!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a manager, your first task is to be able to gather all the weekly status reports. You need to make that process as painless as possible otherwise they will not get written (or at least not submitted). Having managed mostly developers, I want the status reports to work they way that my team works, so I set up a private source control repository to collect the reports. Inside the repository is a folder named after the email alias of each person on the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody on the team has full access to the entire repository - and only those on the team. This means complete transparency between team members. Everybody knows what the others are doing, and how they compare. In many cases, team members will find common threads and proactively reach out to one another. This could be some significant business problem that needs solving, or as small as some helpful travel advice. Whatever it is - it is collaboration which yields dramatic team cohesion and efficiency. All for the low price of fifteen minutes, once per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last minute one-on-one where your boss interrogates you about that status of your team is now instantly painless. A quick &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; of the repository can give you pretty much everything you need to know. The pain of annual reviews becomes a thing of the past as individuals have more direct insight into the work they completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes call this increased agency &amp;quot;write your own annual review&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;write your own promotion&amp;quot;. I encourage individuals to take ownership of their career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a manager, you might be inclined to think that the status report does not contain near enough information. This reporting process is not designed to replace other mechanisms that you have in place (or should have in place). If you need a more detailed view into a specific project, then that should be an additional report or meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Markdown?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, markdown is the magic behind the magic. You might say that markdown is just a file format. These could be Word documents. On a technical level, you are absolutely right. On a practical level, markdown makes the difference... At least for developer-oriented roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a developer wants to start putting together their weekly status report it is just a &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+C Ctrl+V&lt;/code&gt; away. No new process. No new tooling. Not another SaaS login. Works online and offline. Requires no more computing power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to a private source control repository, the effort of writing the weekly status report is again, the same workflow already being used. All done for the week? Toggle to your terminal and use the source control CLI, or whatever you may already have in your IDE/tooling. The &amp;quot;Three P&amp;quot; does not dictate individual workflow - work how you work, use what you use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to keep the barrier to entry as low as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, markdown, as a text-baed format, makes for easy search. As a manager you often have to locate certain details very quickly, and with markdown, your answers are just a &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; away. Markdown is also easy to parse. A splash of your language of choice, and you can post-process weekly reports into a single unified report of everything your team has done for the last week, the last quarter, or even the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept is not new. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People&quot;&gt;Franklin Covey&lt;/a&gt; system is very similar in nature. Carry forward the things you need to do that you did not do today. Agile has the Scrum methodology of accomplishments, goals, and blockers - but that is not a fun acronym. This specific variation is rewarding for both the individual, and the manger, and supports a modern developer workflow. Paired with other strategies, which I will cover in future posts, it is a recipe for effortless time management and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have criticisms? Additions? Are there specifics I left out that you need to understand? Post a comment, and let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Addendum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, as a manager, I have had pretty solid insight into the work the team is doing - if not outright influence and control. This comment should not surprise anybody. However, I have recently encountered a management scenario where that insight and influence is very low. At the very least, insight matters for annual reviews, promotions, etc. Influence matters for reasons of coaching, mentoring, and &amp;quot;firewall&amp;quot; activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, I have recently started requesting a fourth &amp;quot;P&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;Plan&amp;quot;. I ask for a rolling four-week high-level plan painted with broad brushes. I do not need to know how the team spends every hour of their week. I do need to know what feature(s) or issues they intend to tackle. This is the kind of data that one might use in a rollup report for senior management and/or other stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In keeping with he Markdown approach, I have encouraged the use of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://markwhen.com/&quot;&gt;Markwhen&lt;/a&gt; syntax. Since Markwhen has a parser, I can easily extract the parts of the individual reports that I need for the rollup reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every week, each individual on the team (myself included), add the work for the next week to the &amp;quot;Plan&amp;quot; section, and remove the week that just was just completed (past). I cannot be sure yet just how the team will respond to this work long term, but wanted to document the addition and its motivations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reasons to Stencil</title>
      <link href="https://kevinhoyt.com/blog/2021/08/16/reasons-to-stencil/"/>
      <updated>2021-08-16T00:00:00Z</updated>

      <summary>Congratulations, you have decided to use one of the many libraries and tools available for building modern web interfaces.

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you have decided to use one of the many libraries and tools available for building modern web interfaces. Maybe you have chosen React, and you start through the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first React example is a shopping list that extends &lt;code&gt;React.Component&lt;/code&gt;. Congratulations, you have locked you and your team into React. If another team leveraging Vue wants to use your shopping list component, then they are out of luck - they will have to invest the engineering hours to port it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Vue itself, the tutorial starts off by walking you through some of the high-level features - those slick flow control tricks that Vue brings to the table. Eventually however, you are introduced to &lt;code&gt;Vue.component()&lt;/code&gt;. This component of course cannot be shared with the team using React.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Components are the third step in the guide to learning Angular. &amp;quot;Components to the rescue!&amp;quot; is declared before dropping you into &lt;code&gt;component()&lt;/code&gt; and the Component Definition Object (CDO). And of course, these components do not work with the React or Vue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are all these frameworks and libraries so quick to introduce you to components of their own design, when a web-standards approach exists and is widely implemented? To ensure interoperability and operational longevity of your components, build on the standards - use frameworks and libraries to add value to the development process where standards are still nascent or absent entirely. Reevaluate as the standards mature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you might be inclined to think that the standards for components are great, but that they are not idiomatic - they do not work in the same manner - to your chosen framework or library. And you would be right! What is needed is an abstraction that allows you to write the components to the standards, but that provides integrations with Angular, React, and Vue, while leaving the door open for any new technologies that may emerge in the future. The tool you would then be thinking of is, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stenciljs.com/&quot;&gt;Stencil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be inclined to think that the standards for component are great - it is all so verbose. And you would be right! You want to keep that syntactic sugar that increases productivity by decreasing the time it takes to write a component in the first place. You want to lean into reactive patterns with data binding, keep everything organized with separation of styles, and you want modern language constructs like type checking and decorators that come with TypeScript. The tool you would then be wanting is, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stenciljs.com/&quot;&gt;Stencil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are interesting side-effects to investing in standards-based web components. For example, you will see a community develop; all teams contributing to the core patterns of the business regardless of their framework choice. Some of these patterns will be architectural in nature, while others will surface in your design system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leveraging Stencil to build standards-based web components, you bring together the best of both worlds. You can easily share that core functionality across teams using whatever framework they want, while taking advantage of modern development approaches. When you want features like state management and routing, frameworks bring to the table what they do best. At least until the next version when they do not. Either way, that investment in standards with Stencil will still be there, chugging along and adding value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If at some point you decide that building components in general - especially UI components - is simply not core to your business, then the tool you want is &lt;a href=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/&quot;&gt;Ionic Framework&lt;/a&gt;. Ionic Framework components are standards-based components created using Stencil. And because they are web components, they integrate with React, Angular, and Vue.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Items and Renderers</title>

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Consider for a moment the humble list control. It is everywhere. From the social media feed you check in the morning, to your email inbox on the train to work, to the search results for that old western movie you wanted to stream tonight. The pattern of the list control is instantly recognizable, yet it can have so many variations of what it displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article we will take a closer look at building a list component and the different ways we can render content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Humble List&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic list control has three parts. The first is the data to render. This usually takes the form of an array. The second is a place to display that data; usually in the form of a rectangular space on the screen that can be scrolled. The third piece what form that data will take when presented to the person using the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  @&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; data&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Array&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt; = [];
}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example above, the data is an array of string values. The display area is a &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; (content division) tag with a CSS &lt;code&gt;overflow&lt;/code&gt; property set to &lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt; or setting that allows for scrolling. The string values are rendered as individual &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; (paragraph) tags, which can be styled in whatever manner you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of web components, I like to think of the paragraph tag as a &amp;quot;label&amp;quot; component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Inline Items&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all good for an array of strings, but what happens when our data is more complex? Take for example your email inbox. Depending on the state of a message, there are a number of pieces of information displayed to us in a single glance - who the message is from, the subject, perhaps a snippet of the content, the date it was sent, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An array of strings is not going to efficiently hold the data we need. In this case we will use an array of objects. If you are particularly object-oriented, it might be an array of &lt;code&gt;Email&lt;/code&gt; instances, but let us keep with &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; for now so we can focus on the nuances of the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to rendering your list of email messages, you may be initially inclined to update your markup so that you have a place to display all the various pieces of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;avatar&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;initialsFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;from&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;dateFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;date&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;content&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;content&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  @&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; data&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Array&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt; = [];
}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a perfectly acceptable approach, if perhaps a little unwieldy. We could however clean up the markup a bit, by putting it into its own component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;ionx-email-item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;ionx-email-item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  @&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; data&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Array&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt; = [];
}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, keep in mind that if you are more inclined to use strict data types, the attribute on the &lt;code&gt;ionx-email-item&lt;/code&gt; tag would likely be &lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt; and it would accept an instance of an &lt;code&gt;Email&lt;/code&gt; class. Effectively, wherever you see &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; in the above code, would be &lt;code&gt;Email&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Item Renderer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; though, is that it can be whatever you want it to be. This can help us think about our list component in new ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, what we have created here is not so much a list component, but rather an email-list component. When you think of the content division (&lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;) tag or that paragraph (&lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;) tag, they can be used in myriad of ways. This list component can only be used to display email; and potentially only from an &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;Email&lt;/code&gt; instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make our list into a generic list - a list that can list rows of a variety of items - we need to think about abstracting the content that gets rendered. To account for this, we can add a property that lets the developer using our component specify what tag should be used to render the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; Tag &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;itemRenderer &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;ionx-label-item&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;itemRenderer&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  @&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;reflect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; itemRenderer&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; string&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  @&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; data&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Array&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt; = [];
}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Tag&lt;/code&gt; is special in JSX - it is a JSX variable. The variable name does not have to be the word &amp;quot;Tag&amp;quot; but it must start with an uppercase letter. The &lt;code&gt;Tag&lt;/code&gt; variable gets assigned to it a string representing a tag to be used in the render. Then inside the render, wherever you might use &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; you use &lt;code&gt;Tag&lt;/code&gt;.  Now, the tag that will be rendered is whatever tag name is supplied to the &lt;code&gt;itemRenderer&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;ionx-list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;item-renderer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;ionx-email-item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;ionx-list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you should need to dynamically change the tag name for each iteration in the loop, you put some extra syntax to how you declare the map function. First, use braces to denote a function block, and then provide a &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; with the tag and necessary attributes mapped as you typically would with JSX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; Tag &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;ionx-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;kind&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;-field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;hidden&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can even use the spread operator of JavaScript if you do not know all the properties of the object in the iteration: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Tag {... value}&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/Tag&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This will look very familiar to React developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you have now is a truly generic list component. This approach does come with a couple caveats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Object&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and most notable side effect of this approach is that it really likes &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt;. It almost relies on the typeless nature of JavaScript. With this comes potential challenges in debugging and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Label Item&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;code&gt;itemRenderer&lt;/code&gt; can be specified from outside of our implementation, we should not assume a value will be provided. In that instance we might be inclined to fall back to a &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with using a &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; tag is that we have an array of object instances. When you render something declared as an object, as a string, the &lt;code&gt;Object.toString()&lt;/code&gt; method is called, and you get something like &lt;code&gt;[Object]&lt;/code&gt; displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to address this problem, a default item renderer component must be created. In the above example, if no &lt;code&gt;itemRenderer&lt;/code&gt; is defined, then &lt;code&gt;ionx-label-item&lt;/code&gt; will be used as the tag. The &lt;code&gt;ionx-label-item&lt;/code&gt; component is really just a &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; tag, where the &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; property is declared as a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;LabelItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  @&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; value&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; string&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is not a substantial amount of work to create this &amp;quot;label&amp;quot; component, it is more work, and an additional step to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now pass an array of objects to our list, or an array of strings depending on if we have provided an item renderer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example without an item renderer...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;ionx-list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;ionx-list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; list &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;ionx-list&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
list&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Stencil&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Appflow&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example that specifies an item renderer for a product list...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;ionx-list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;item-renderer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;ionx-product-item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;ionx-list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; list &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;querySelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;ionx-list&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
list&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;company&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Ionic&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Stencil&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;company&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Ionic&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Appflow&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The validity of this approach could be argued within the context of a list component. Is this too much overhead work just to abstract how the list displays its contents? Maybe. Knowing how to create dynamic tags in JSX however, comes in pretty handy once you know it exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have already mentioned how I have used this approach before on dynamic form content. Another area where I have used it is in a &amp;quot;table&amp;quot; component where the columns - and how they are to be displayed - are defined by the developer using the component [in the markup].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time you look at a list, you will never think of it the same way. If you want to look at the complete code for this example, it is available on GitHub. There is also a &lt;a href=&quot;http://temp.kevinhoyt.com/ionic/list/&quot;&gt;live demonstration&lt;/a&gt; of the list component in action.&lt;/p&gt;

Every once in a while though, you need to roll your own. Not to worry! With a splash of SVG and helping hand from Stencil, you can create a chart as a web component for all to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Array of Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most charting libraries can get pretty complex. Most of that has to do with abstracting how data is represented. Those abstractions are what make the library so useful in so many cases. In this case however, we are not building a library for all the cases, we are building a bar chart to meet our specific case. This can simplify our work dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia, in a bar chart &amp;quot;One axis of the chart shows the specific categories being compared, and the other axis represents a measured value.&amp;quot; According to me, a bar chart is an array of numbers. Let us start there, with some SVG and an array of numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; Component&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; h&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Prop &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;@stencil/core&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

@&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;ionx-chart&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;styleUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;chart.css&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;shadow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Chart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;svg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;320&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;240&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;svg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Values to use in the chart&lt;/span&gt;
  @&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; data&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Array&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt; = [];  
}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; is going to take up the same amount of space along one of the axes. For this example, we will use the horizontal axis. The horizontal axis is &lt;code&gt;320&lt;/code&gt; pixels across. If we get ten (10) values in the &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt;, each bar will take up &lt;code&gt;32&lt;/code&gt; pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Maximum Ratio&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, we are almost there. The last piece of information we need to know before we can render the chart, is the largest (maximum) value (number) in the &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt;. We need to know the maximum because we are looking to establish a ratio. We want the maximum value in the &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; to equal the available number of pixels we have along the vertical axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; ratio&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if the values in the array are all larger than the &lt;code&gt;240&lt;/code&gt; pixels we have along the vertical axis, how do we render the bar? Let us say the maximum value in the &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;1,000&lt;/code&gt;. The available space we have &lt;code&gt;240&lt;/code&gt; divided by the maximum value of &lt;code&gt;1,000&lt;/code&gt; gives us a ratio of &lt;code&gt;240:1,000&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;0.24&lt;/code&gt;. Now we can multiply any &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;0.24&lt;/code&gt;, and we will know the height of the bar &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; that bar will fit in our viewable area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not believe me? Let us say that the next &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;500&lt;/code&gt;. The value of &lt;code&gt;500&lt;/code&gt; is half of &lt;code&gt;1,000&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;1,000&lt;/code&gt; equals all our vertical pixels (&lt;code&gt;240&lt;/code&gt;),  then &lt;code&gt;500&lt;/code&gt; should equal half our vertical pixels, or &lt;code&gt;120&lt;/code&gt;. Ready for this? &lt;code&gt;500 * 0.24 = 120&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Will Render&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we render the &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; we will need a place to figure out that maximum value and corresponding ratio. The best place for that from a Stencil perspective is in &lt;code&gt;componentWillRender()&lt;/code&gt;, which is called before each render.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;componentWillRender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; maximum&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Find the largest value&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; d&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; d &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; d&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    maximum &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; maximum&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;d&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Round up to nearest whole number&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Assign the ratio&lt;/span&gt;
  maximum&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Math&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ceil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; maximum &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;ratio &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;240&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; maximum&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should become pretty clear, pretty quickly, that the limiting factor of our chart, and indeed any chart, is the amount of data to render. Not because rendering takes a long time, but because figuring out the edges of our data does. This is why supercomputers have to be used for weather maps, when all you see is some colored splotches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bar chart however, is not a weather map. We can do all this processing (and a considerable amount more) right here in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Render&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have all the pertinent pieces of information, we need to put those bars on the screen! A bar in SVG is a &lt;code&gt;rect&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;rect&lt;/code&gt; needs to know where it is positioned (&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;)  and its dimensions (&lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; we already know will be the value (number) in this iteration of the &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; multiplied by the &lt;code&gt;ratio&lt;/code&gt; we calculated earlier. We also talked about how the &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; of each bar is the amount of space we have along the horizontal axis (&lt;code&gt;320&lt;/code&gt;) divided by the number of values in the &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;. We do not know how many values that will be, so we calculate it inline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; position is almost identical, except we multiply the &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; by the &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; of the iteration. If the &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;50&lt;/code&gt; pixels, the first iteration (&lt;code&gt;index === 0&lt;/code&gt;) will result in &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; being zero (0). Yes, please! The next iteration (&lt;code&gt;index === 1&lt;/code&gt;) multiplied by a &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;50&lt;/code&gt; places &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;code&gt;50&lt;/code&gt;. Exactly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;svg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;320&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;240&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;

          &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;value &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;ratio&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;svg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only one that is a little tricky in SVG-land is the &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; position. When we think of the Web, we generally think of the top-left of the screen as being (&lt;code&gt;0, 0&lt;/code&gt;) on the coordinate system.  In the case of SVG however (&lt;code&gt;0, 0&lt;/code&gt;) is at the bottom left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that if we placed &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;code&gt;240&lt;/code&gt; and then said the &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;rect&lt;/code&gt; was &lt;code&gt;100&lt;/code&gt;, the resulting &lt;code&gt;rect&lt;/code&gt; would actually be drawn off the SVG viewport (from &lt;code&gt;240&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;340&lt;/code&gt;). In order to offset this, we subtract the calculated &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; using our &lt;code&gt;ratio&lt;/code&gt;, from the &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; of the viewable area of the SVG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to see each bar, the &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; is a randomly generated CSS &lt;code&gt;rgb()&lt;/code&gt; value. This kind of begs the question &amp;quot;Maybe the bar should be abstracted into a class that includes fill color?&amp;quot; Yup! And congratulations on coming full circle - that is exactly what the charting libraries do; abstract all the things. How far you go with it is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;✋ But What About ...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two examples included in the running &lt;a href=&quot;http://temp.kevinhoyt.com/ionic/chart/&quot;&gt;demonstration&lt;/a&gt;, and the GitHub &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krhoyt/Ionic/tree/master/chart&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt;. One example is the chart that we have just created. The other example is a chart that includes many of the typical considerations you might find in a chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chart title&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Axis labels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value labels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic fill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rounded corners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexible sizing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS properties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is not abstracted to the point of a library, but it should give you a starting place to consider more sophisticated rendering situations for your own chart component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these options definitely add complexity to the math and rendering, but it all follows the same pattern. First, figure out the structure of the data. Second, figure out the edges of the data. Third, consider any information you might need to calculate for layout. Finally, iterate over the data to render your output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the next time you need a custom chart, you will know where to start - with Stencil and web components.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Secret Life of Tabs</title>

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As user interfaces (UI) go, tabs are a particularly useful pattern. The word &amp;quot;tab&amp;quot; invokes images of beige manila file folders. Early UI mimicked this physical property by placing buttons along the top of a dedicated space. Mobile devices, with their confined spaces, finds the tab pattern in accordions, bottom button bars, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example we will look at the mechanics of building a tab component using &lt;a href=&quot;https://stenciljs.com/&quot;&gt;Stencil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Composition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us talk for a moment about composition. How does a component magically grow a tab? In Web Components parlance, composition refers to the idea that a component can have other HTML elements, including components, inside of the opening and closing tags. What the parent component does with that content is up to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;ionx-tabs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Content 1&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Content 2&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Content 3&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;ionx-tabs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the above HTML snippet, in the case of a tab component, we would expect to have something like three buttons, each controlling the visibility of one child element at a time. Believe it or not, there is almost enough information here to make that happen. The only piece of information missing is what to label the buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Data Attributes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the great features of HTML is how extensible it can be. One of the ways that HTML accomplishes this is through the use of data attributes. Data attributes have this name because you can use the word &amp;quot;data&amp;quot; followed by a hyphen, and then whatever word you want to use. As an attribute, like many other defined HTML element attributes, a data attribute can also be assigned a value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;ionx-tabs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;One&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Content 1&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;Two&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Content 2&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;Three&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Content 3&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;ionx-tabs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A data attribute does not have to be assigned a value, in which case, it will be treated as a &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt; value. CSS can also be applied using the CSS attribute selector such as &lt;code&gt;input[type=text] { ... }&lt;/code&gt;. We will circle back to both of these concepts later in this example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work with data attributes from JavaScript, we have a few functions at our disposal. If the data attribute contains a value, we can use &lt;code&gt;getAttribute()&lt;/code&gt; to get that value. Conversely, we can use &lt;code&gt;setAttribute()&lt;/code&gt; to set that value. If we do not want the data attribute to be present, we can use &lt;code&gt;removeAttribute()&lt;/code&gt;. In the case of a &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt; value, we want to check if the attribute is present (true) or not (false). For this we can use &lt;code&gt;hasAttribute()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a markup perspective, this is enough to generate, and label, the buttons that control the visible content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Is A Tab?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above markup, we are considering any child element to be representative of a piece of content whose visibility is controlled by a button, which is called a &amp;quot;tab&amp;quot; by convention. We have already decided that a tab has a label, but there are other properties to consider as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first additional property would be if the tab is selected or not. This is important not only internally, to hide content that is not selected, but also for the purposes of styling. A selected tab should have a different appearance than a tab that is not selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A selected tab should also look different from a disabled tab... Disabled... There is another property! Depending on the state of the application using the tabs, we may also want to disable specific tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Tab&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  disabled&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  label&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  selected&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; 
    label&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
    selected&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
    disabled&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;label &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; label&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;selected &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; selected&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;disabled &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; disabled&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely related to disabled is visibility, which we can consider another property of a tab. Your tabs might have icons, which could be considered another property of the tab. Maybe you want the ability to &amp;quot;pin&amp;quot; tabs. Whatever properties you find relevant to your tab implementation, bundle them up into a class. This class will allow us to refer logically to each tab and its related properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Component Properties&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have a good grasp on the markup that should represent our tab component, and we even have a logical representation of the individual tabs. Now we will turn to the implementation itself, starting with the component properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get access to the child elements (composed content), we will need a reference to the web component element itself. This is called the &amp;quot;host element&amp;quot; in Stencil. From a web component standards perspective &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; is the same as the host element. To get a reference to this host element in Stencil, the &lt;code&gt;@Element()&lt;/code&gt; decorator is used. You can name the property whatever you want, but convention is &amp;quot;host&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token decorator&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token at operator&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; host&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; HTMLElement&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also want the component to keep track of the state of the tabs, which means an &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;Tabs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token decorator&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token at operator&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; tabs&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Tab&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an object-oriented programming perspective &lt;code&gt;tabs&lt;/code&gt; is a property of the component class. From a component perspective, it represents the state of the tabs, and is decorated appropriately. This is not to be confused with the properties decorated with &lt;code&gt;@Prop()&lt;/code&gt;. These are properties, too, but are decorated to control how the component manifests itself to the developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our component will also need to keep track of the selected tab. To keep things easy, we can use a zero-based index to represent selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token decorator&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token at operator&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Prop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;mutable&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; reflected&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; selectedIndex&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selected index will change when a tab is clicked. When a component modifies one of its properties directly, it must be marked as &lt;code&gt;mutable&lt;/code&gt;. We will also want to let the developer programmatically control the selected tab, as well as determine which tab is selected. Both of these purposes are served by marking a property as &lt;code&gt;reflected&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Slots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside of a web component template, the &lt;code&gt;slot&lt;/code&gt; tag allows us to specify where child content should go within the context of the overall layout of the component itself. If you need to specify more than one designated area for child content, you can name the slots, and then use those names on the child elements. If you choose not to have a &lt;code&gt;slot&lt;/code&gt; tag at all, then the child content will not be shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- In a component template --&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- In your HTML --&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;my-component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;slot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;My Label&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;slot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;content&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;/img/stencil.svg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;my-component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Slot Change&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the elements inside of a web component slot are changed, the component emits an internal &lt;code&gt;slotchange&lt;/code&gt; event. Capturing this event allows a web component to take any special actions it needs to address the change. In the case of a tab control, we can leverage this event to know the component needs to evaluate the child content, and may in turn need to update the buttons representing the tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Template&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the tab component template, we need two distinct areas - one to hold the buttons which represent the tabs themselves, and one to hold the desired content to be rendered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;tabs&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; tab&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Tab&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; index&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;button
          onClick&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;selectedIndex &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; index&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token string-property property&quot;&gt;&#39;data-selected&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; tab&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;selected&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
          title&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;tab&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;tab&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;label&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;slot onSlotchange&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;doSlotChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;slot&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;        
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a tab button is clicked, the index of the selected button is assigned to the &lt;code&gt;selectedIndex&lt;/code&gt; property. This will invoke a render. True to form, and in sticking with the data attributes, if a tab is selected, it will have the &lt;code&gt;data-selected&lt;/code&gt; attribute. This is then picked up in the CSS to style the button accordingly. The same is true for any disabled tab, in which case the button gets a &lt;code&gt;disabled&lt;/code&gt; attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;button[data-selected]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #f4f4f4&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;border-left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; solid 1px transparent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;border-top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; solid 2px #0f62fe&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #161616&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;font-weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 600&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;button[disabled]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #c6c6c6&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; #8d8d8d&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;cursor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; not-allowed&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; holding the content (via a &lt;code&gt;slot&lt;/code&gt;), when the &lt;code&gt;slotchange&lt;/code&gt; event is fired, the &lt;code&gt;doSlotChange()&lt;/code&gt; handler is called. The &lt;code&gt;doSlotChange()&lt;/code&gt; handler evaluates the child elements, and populates the &lt;code&gt;tabs&lt;/code&gt; property accordingly. When the &lt;code&gt;tabs&lt;/code&gt; property is changed, a render is invoked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;doSlotChange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;tabs &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;host&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;children&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; c&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; label&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;host&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;children&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;data-label&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; selected&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;selectedIndex &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; disabled&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;host&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;children&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;c&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;hasAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;data-disabled&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Render&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to this point we have put a lot of focus on the buttons that represent the tabs of our component. We still have one last concern - the visibility of the content within our tab component. We want to make sure that the visible content stays in sync with the buttons that control that visibility. The best place to do this is a quick check in the &lt;code&gt;componentWillRender()&lt;/code&gt; lifecycle function.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;tabs&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;t&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;selected &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;host&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;children&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;t&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;removeAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;data-selected&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;tabs&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;t&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;selected &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might seem odd that assigning or removing a &lt;code&gt;data-selected&lt;/code&gt; attribute on the children elements is what controls their visibility. This happens because within the context of web components, CSS has the &lt;code&gt;::slotted()&lt;/code&gt; selector which allows you to target specific elements within a &lt;code&gt;slot&lt;/code&gt;. In this case, any child element that does not have the &lt;code&gt;data-selected&lt;/code&gt; attribute is hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;::slotted( :not( [data-selected] ) )&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; none&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, our tab component is complete! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The component itself is not that complex, but it does involve taking into account just about every aspect of building web components. You need to understand composable content, how that translates into slots inside of components, and then how that can be managed in CSS. You need to understand the lifecycle of a web component with &lt;code&gt;slotchange&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;componentWillRender()&lt;/code&gt;. And you need to understand how we can extend HTML using data attributes, and they can be used in CSS. And now? You do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;✋ But What About ...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unordered List&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I display the tab buttons as &lt;code&gt;button&lt;/code&gt; elements inside of a &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; container element. Since the tabs represent a list of options, the &lt;code&gt;ul&lt;/code&gt; element may seem like a better fit. If you had no other function in your tabs save to label content, then the &lt;code&gt;ul&lt;/code&gt; element would certainly be a good choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, I am taking advantage of a special behavior of the &lt;code&gt;button&lt;/code&gt; element in that it already has a &lt;code&gt;disabled&lt;/code&gt; attribute. When the &lt;code&gt;disabled&lt;/code&gt; attribute is present, the button does not emit a click event. Using the &lt;code&gt;button&lt;/code&gt; element means I do not have to write additional code to manage the event listener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might then in turn suggest putting a &lt;code&gt;button&lt;/code&gt; element inside the &lt;code&gt;li&lt;/code&gt; element as part of a &lt;code&gt;ul&lt;/code&gt; element. At this point I would suggest we are splitting semantic hairs on content that is hidden in the shadow DOM in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logical Tabs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, we used a &lt;code&gt;Tab&lt;/code&gt; class to hold the properties that are related to what a tab should represent. If I were using plain JavaScript, and not TypeScript, then I would not even bother making the class in the first place, and just keep an &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a case can be made for going the other way as well - formalizing a &lt;code&gt;Tab&lt;/code&gt; component, perhaps using it as the container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;my-tabs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;my-tab&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;One&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Content 1&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;my-tab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;my-tab&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;Two&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Content 2&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;my-tab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;my-tab&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;Three&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;disabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Content 3&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;my-tab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;my-tabs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/tabs&quot;&gt;Ionic Framework&lt;/a&gt; takes this approach. In fact, because of the myriad situations in which a truly generic tab component may be used, Ionic Framework actually breaks the structure down even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is good for Ionic Framework, but this example is not teaching how to use Ionic Framework tabs. Rather this example is about how to implement the baseline tab UI pattern for your own components. For this reason, I kept this example as spartan as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have an understanding of all the moving parts of this pattern, maybe you will want to layer in some abstractions of your own. Maybe you will go the declarative route and add in specific components for the tab buttons. Or perhaps you might decide to allow the developer to specify a renderer to use for those buttons. Maybe you will add animation between the tab contents. Maybe you will implement an accordion rather than tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you get the hang of the pattern, you will find uses for it in many places. The complete code for this example is in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krhoyt/Ionic/tree/master/tabs&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, and there is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://temp.kevinhoyt.com/ionic/tabs/&quot;&gt;live demo&lt;/a&gt; you can view as well.&lt;/p&gt;
