      <h1>Cigar Lounges</h1>
      <time>Dec 2, 2022 &bull; 6 min read</time>
      <p>In this day of negative sentiment towards smoking you might be inclined to think that the cigar lounge would be a dying breed. As bars, restaurants, and public spaces alike ban smoking, brothers of the leaf (BOTL) find sanctuary in their local cigar lounge.</p>
<p>As a frequent traveler, I find myself in the position of getting to experience the character of these fine establishments all over the world. This then is my ode to the character, and characters, of the places I have encountered along the way.</p>
<h3>Boisdale of Canary Wharf</h3>
<p><em>15 Cabot Square, Canary Wharf, London E14 4QT, UK</em><br>
Last visited: July 2, 2017</p>
<p><img src="/img/lounge/boisdale.canary.jpg" alt="Go Scottish with Scotch."></p>
<p>There are several <a href="https://www.boisdale.co.uk">Boisdale</a> locations around London, all of which are smoker friendly. The Canary Wharf location features a plush, enclosed, lounge where you can get high-end food, drink, and cigars. The Scottish decor begs a single malt pairing. An attendant will see to your every need along the way.</p>
<h3>Casbar Cigar (previously Slo Burn)</h3>
<p><em>10449 S Parker Rd, Parker, CO 80134</em><br>
Last visited: December, 2019</p>
<p><img src="/img/lounge/slo.burn.jpg" alt="The testosterone overfloweth."></p>
<p>The little town of Parker, CO, located on the southeast side of Denver, CO actually has <em>two</em> cigar lounges, of which Casbar has the larger lounge, and is what most would consider more traditional. There is public seating in the front, and a private lounge in the back. Televisions and leather recliners are in abundant supply. Sizable walk-in humidor with a wide selection, and regular events to cater to every interest.</p>
<h3>Cigar Bar and Grill</h3>
<p><em>850 Montgomery St, San Francisco, CA 94133</em><br>
Last visited: April 24, 2018</p>
<p><img src="/img/lounge/cigar.bar.sf.jpg" alt="Cigars. Downtown. SF."></p>
<p>Cigar smoking, food, and liquor in downtown San Francisco, CA? You bet! Formally a restaurant with live music, salsa lessons, and more, attached to an open-air, heated, patio. The food is really good, if a little on the expenseive side. And the same could be said for the small humidor.</p>
<h3>Cigars at No. 10</h3>
<p><em>10 Manchester St, Marylebone, London W1U 4DG, UK</em><br>
Last visited: July 17, 2017</p>
<p><img src="/img/lounge/cigars.at.no.ten.jpg" alt="High class. Or. Not."></p>
<p>Technically a hotel, with an outstanding restaurant, there is a small-ish, but very comfortable outdoor smoking area (COSA) in the back. The area is heated, with a privacy screen for your pleasure. The staff is very attentive, and highly trained. They will escort you to their humidor, which is well-stocked with a large assortment of Cuban cigars. Just be prepared for the bespoke price tag.</p>
<h3>Havana Cigar Lounge</h3>
<p><em>4850 W Flamingo Rd #18, Las Vegas, NV 89103</em><br>
Last visited: February 21, 2018</p>
<p><img src="/img/lounge/havana.cigar.vegas.jpg" alt="Dark. Plush. Classic."></p>
<p>On a rare, rainy, late afternoon in Las Vegas, I slipped off the strip to Havana Cigar Lounge. The doors at the front and the back of the store were propped open. A cool breeze drifted through keeping the air fresh. The humidor was lightly stocked, but had a respectable variety. The host popped in a video showcasing James J. Fox in London - another lounge in this list.</p>
<h3>Havana Garage</h3>
<p><em>1008 Howard St, Omaha, NE 68102</em><br>
Last visited: September 6, 2018</p>
<p><img src="/img/lounge/havana.garage.omaha.jpg" alt="People watching on the Old Market."></p>
<p>The Old Market in downtown Omaha, Nebraska, is a trendy, night-life destination pretty much any day of the week. Nestled on the brick-lined main street, is Havana Garage, where you can have a cigar, choose from a wide variety of alcoholic beverages, and people watch the night away. Well stocked, if a little pricey, humidor in the basement.</p>
<h3>Habana House Cigar Lounge</h3>
<p><em>13729 Research Blvd #1075, Austin, TX 78750</em><br>
Last visited: August 26, 2019</p>
<p><img src="/img/lounge/habana.house.austin.jpg" alt="Walk right in, sit right down."></p>
<p>This lounge has three distinct seating areas, each with its own set of televisions. Pick your area - news, sports, history, fiction. The massive walk-in humidor will be sure to offer something to fit your palate. A variety of food options are within walking distance (even in the Austin summer). Spacious patio in the front.</p>
<h3>James J. Fox</h3>
<p><em>19 St James's St, St. James's, London SW1A 1ES, UK</em><br>
Last visited: August 26, 2017</p>
<p><img src="/img/lounge/james.j.fox.jpg" alt="Sit in the same chair as Churchill himself."></p>
<p>Do you like a churchill? Would you like to sit in the chair, in the lounge, where Winston Churchill would visit for a cigar? Welcome home! With a cigar museum, fantastic selection and service, and a spacious lounge, it is hard to beat the historic pleasure of <a href="https://www.jjfox.co.uk/">James J. Fox</a>.</p>
<h3>Maduros</h3>
<p><em>2997 Cumberland Blvd SE, Atlanta, GA 30339</em><br>
Last visited: March 6, 2019</p>
<p><img src="/img/lounge/maduros.jpg" alt="Get your funky drink on."></p>
<p>If you are catching a Braves game, or are in the Galleria area for a conference, and you want to grab a cigar, an adult beverage, and get your funk on, then you have come to the right spot. Part night club, part cigar lounge, <a href="https://maduroscigarshop.com">Maduros</a> has a smallish humidor, but with enough variety for every stogie lover. And did I mention adult beverages?</p>
<h3>Orlando Cigar and Tobacco</h3>
<p><em>9924 Universal Blvd #218, Orlando, FL 32819</em><br>
Last visited: July 21, 2019</p>
<p><img src="/img/lounge/orlando.cigars.tobacco.jpg" alt="Theme park getaway for the suburban dad."></p>
<p>If you are in Orlando, FL, and looking for the quintessential cigar lounge - this is not it. If you are a suburban dad, booked in the VRBO at <a href="https://www.vistacayholidays.com">Vista Cay</a> across the street, and looking for a little escape from theme park madness and kids - you have found your nirvana. Pick up a beverage at the Publix on the way in, or have some tea at the shop.</p>
<h3>Rocky Mountain Cigar Company</h3>
<p><em>640 Unit C Rt. 285, Fairplay, CO 80440</em><br>
Last visited: December 1, 2022</p>
<p><img src="/img/lounge/rocky.mountain.cigar.company.jpg" alt="The highest cigar lounge in the world."></p>
<p>With Breckenridge, CO and the surrounding towns becoming obtusely restrictive around smoking, why not take the 30-minute drive over the beautifully scenic Hoosier Pass into downtown Fairplay, CO, and settle in with your favorite cigar? This comfortable lounge also offers indoor golf and a selection of alcoholic beverages.</p>
<h3>Smoking Cave</h3>
<p><em>5435 Boatworks Dr, Highlands Ranch, CO 80126</em><br>
Last visited: Every Friday</p>
<p><img src="/img/lounge/smoking.cave.jpg" alt="A cave with a mermaid view."></p>
<p>Probably the most well-known cigar lounge in the Denver metro, where the humidor has a large selection and the best prices in town. The front of the store is open to the public and has a dozen or so leather seats for your smoking pleasure. The vast members lounge has several rooms (yes, rooms) appointed with a variety of leather seats. Special events abound, usually with free food. Say &quot;Hello!&quot; to Slick Rick at the cashier's counter; the grumpiest nice person I know.</p>
<h3>Tobacco Leaf</h3>
<p><em>6870 S Rainbow Blvd #118, Las Vegas, NV 89118</em><br>
Last visited: February 22, 2018</p>
<p><img src="/img/lounge/tobacco.leaf.4.jpg" alt="Lounge in the back."></p>
<p>What?! You go to Las Vegas and you head to a shop off the strip? Yes. Yes I do. The tiled room in the back with a dozen or so leather chairs is a perfect escape from the constant barrage of casino noise. A lengthy, and well-categorized, humidor runs along the length of most of the store where you are sure to find a stick of your liking.</p>
