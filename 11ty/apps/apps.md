title: Applications
---

I do more management work these days than contributing to a code repository. Still, I am a developer at heart. I write code. I build apps. Usually applications to soothe pains or needs that I have. I build apps for me. They may be apps that are useful to you. Here is a heavily curated list of applications, designed and developed by me, which I actively maintain or obsess about in some fashion.

> Any one of these, or multiples, may be broken or non-functional at any given time. This usually means that I am actively working on that application.

### Quinn
**Did you take your medication today?**
*Mobile*

Like many Americans, I take a daily medication. Remembering to take that medication can sometimes be problematic for me. There are any number of applications out there that track and notify you about your medications, so why another? Mostly because I do not need specific tracking or notifications. All I have is one question: *Did you take you medication today?* Either I did, or I did not, and I can take the appropriate action from there.

Also, I wanted to play with calendaring, and was geeking out about [Adobe Spectrum](https://spectrum.adobe.com/).

> **Disclaimer:** I am not a doctor. This is not medical advice.

### Pee and See
**Monitor your hydration levels by how frequently you pee.**
*Mobile*

This is not my idea. A native version of this [application exists](https://www.peeandseeit.com/), and was created by another developer. As a data analysis geek however, and as somebody who closely monitors their hydration levels, I love the concept. My only problem with the native application developed by somebody else? Whoa, is it ugly.

I considered it a personal challenge to leverage my UX skills to update the application in a manner that respects the original concept, but evolved to something more refined. Also, since I build with the Web, it now works on both Android and iOS. Yeah!

### Avocado Remote Manager
**Manage your remote team with confidence.**
*Desktop*

Avocado is broader brand I have been trying to put together for a while. It has two parts. One part is about managing a remote team (welcome to the post-pandemic world), and the second part is about managing developer relations communities. Both projects are something I developed for my own use, and have evolved over time. Both projects are open source and hosted online to use if you do not want to install or maintain any infrastructure.

Remote Manager includes a contact manager, meeting notes and related action items, 1:1 tracking, weekly status reports, professional growth monitoring, shared documents, and link management.

### Avocado Community Manager
**Manage professional communities and developer relations activities.**
*Desktop*

Community Manager feels very much like Remote Manager because, just like a remote team in a corporate environment, a community is effectively a remote team, only the technology takes center stage, not the corporation. 

At the core of this idea is that developer relations activities, whether by a corporate team, or by individual community members, leaves a trail - or at least it should. Community Manager is then designed to aggregate those data trails and analyze them for trends, or to be used in reporting. There is also a lightweight event management section.

### [Taste Buddy](https://tastebuddy.app/)
**Remember all your favorite tastes, all the time.**
*Mobile (desktop planned)*

When I met Dave Selden, and saw his [33 Books](https://www.33books.com/), I started down a journey that would last the next decade. Most of that time has been waiting for the Web to grow up. The other part of that time has been waiting for me to grow up. Taste Buddy endeavors to combine all of the 33 Books essentials into a single application, while retaining the heart of the physical product. I currently plan to bring this to market as a commercial application, under a freemium model.
