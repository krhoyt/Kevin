## Summary

Technical community builder with hands-on software engineering experience and a strong track record growing developer communities around complex platforms. Known for translating difficult systems - simulation, AI/ML, IoT, and distributed architectures - into practical tutorials, demos, and example projects that developers actually use.

Comfortable engaging developers where they already are (Discord, Twitter/X, LinkedIn), answering technical questions, building sample code, and closing the loop between community feedback and product teams. Self-directed, curious, and fast-learning in technical domains.

## Core Skills

**Developer Community Engagement:** Discord moderation, social engagement, AMAs, workshops, ambassador programs.

**Technical Enablement:** Sample code, reference architectures, CLI workflows, getting-started guides.

**Software Engineering:** JavaScript, Python, Node.js, REST APIs, SDKs, full-stack prototyping.

**Simulation & Systems Thinking:** Distributed systems, event-driven architecture, IoT, ML workflows.

**Developer Content:** Tutorials, demos, walkthroughs, integration guides, videos.

**Product Feedback Loops:** Translating developer pain points into actionable product insights.
