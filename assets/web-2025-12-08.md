The intersection of development and design.

Full-stack technologist and lifelong maker who has spent decades building software, exploring data, tinkering with hardware, and helping developers succeed. My work spans UX/UI, web standards, application development, data analytics, AI/ML, and practical problem-solving — and I still love learning something new every day.

## Skills Snapshot

- **Developer Enablement:** Documentation, samples, developer tooling, education, and DX strategy.
- **Web Architecture:** Modern UI/UX, Web Components, and standards-based client architecture.
- **Application Development:** APIs, backend services, automation tools, and production-ready systems.
- **Data & Analytics:** Database design, real-time telemetry, data pipelines, and insight generation.
- **AI & Machine Learning:** Model training, computer vision, inference pipelines, and applied ML tooling.

## Featured Writing

**Teaching Watson to See My Garage**

*AI/ML, IoT*

A Raspberry Pi camera and custom-trained Watson model detect whether a garage door is open or closed. Combines ML, image processing, and IoT.

**Building a Bar Chart with Stencil**

*Web, Data*

Every once in a while you need to roll your own. With a splash of SVG and helping hand from Stencil, you can create a custom chart as a web component.

**AWS Transcribe with Python**

*App Dev, AI/ML*

Upload an audio file to S3, manage the details of an AWS Transcribe job, and download the results. Include code to clean up after yourself if you are so inclined.

**Getting Comfortable with Circles**

*Web, Data*

In this post, we put aside the charting libraries, dive into some circle math, and discover that building lightweight custom charts is easier than you think.

**Real-Time Drone Telemetry**

*IoT, Data*

A real-time telemetry demo using a drone, sensors, wireless links, and satellite uplink to stream flight-style data to the cloud, illustrating a modern "black box."

**Developer Advocacy and the Project Triangle**

*Enablement*

A reflection on how the classic Project Triangle applies to developer relations, exploring the trade-offs when building authentic developer communities.

## Featured Projects

**Flavor Awesome**

*Web, IndexedDB, AI/ML*

Developed for people with a mouth. Assists with palate development for people looking to improve their understanding of the foods they consume. From hobbyist to connoisseur. Robust data visualization, AI recommendations, and custom form controls.

**Anno Awesome**

*Serverless, Web Architecture*

A comprehensive year-at-a-glance calendar. Built with Web Components, embracing a MacOS look and feel. Supports multiple calendars and limited sharing via cloud object storage and serverless integration.

**Diesel**

*Web, LDAP, API, SQLite*

Built for a pharmacuetical company to digitally track and manage controlled substances. Replaced a paper-based workflow to mitigate risk and improve accountability and efficiency. Roles-based features.
