- Warp Test Drive: AI is coming for your terminal. I spent an afternoon testing Warp's Agentic Development. The results were surprising, humbling, and kind of inspiring.

- Svelte 5 Ownership Mutation: Svelte data binding is a joy, but you can work yourself into a corner if you are not careful. Take a closer look at some edge cases to stay on track.

- Getting Comfortable with Circles: In this post, we put aside the charting libraries, dive into some circle math, and discover that building lightweight custom charts is easier than you think.

- Four D Time Management: Time management is a key "soft" skill for Information Technology professionals. This heavily distilled version of Getting Things Done will help you master your time, and lower your stress.

- AWS Transcribe with Python: Upload an audio file to S3, manage the details of an AWS Transcribe job, and download the results. Include code to clean up after yourself if you are so inclined.

- Three P Weekly Status Report: My term for agile status reports. These weekly reports make a manager's job much easier - and setup employees for success. Let us take a look at how I structure and run my weekly reports.

- Reasons to Stencil: Congratulations, you have decided to use one of the many libraries and tools available for building modern web interfaces. Now just do not lock yourself into that decision.

- Items and Renderers: Consider for a moment the humble list control. In this article we take a closer look at building a list control, and the different ways to render content.

- Building a Bar Chart with Stencil: Every once in a while you need to roll your own. With a splash of SVG and helping hand from Stencil, you can create a custom chart as a web component.

- The Secret Life of Tabs: As user interfaces (UI) go, tabs are a particularly useful pattern. In this example we will look at the mechanics of building a tab component using Stencil.

- Building a Clock with Stencil: Building a clock can reveal a lot about how a platform works. In this walkthrough we will take a look at building a clock component using Stencil.

- Building a Calendar with Stencil: Learn about calculating content before rendering while building a calendar component with Stencil. Styling allows you to drop the result into your iOS application.

- Functions, Storage, Watson ... Oh, My!: Recently Apache OpenWhisk (IBM Cloud Functions) released a beta feature around triggers for Cloud Object Storage, and I figured I would take it for a spin.

- IBM and the Open Organization: A review of Red Hat CEO, Jim Whitehurst's book, The Open Organization, wherein I attempt to distill the why, how, and what contents into my favorite quotes.

- Serverless Storage Redux: In previous posts you can read about uploading and download a file with IBM Cloud Functions. In those posts I use an SDK. This time we look at the REST API.

- Serverless Download from Object Storage: In a previous post, I walked through how to upload a file to an IBM Cloud Function. In this post, we will get it back out, and download it to an HTTP client.

- Serverless Upload to Object Storage: Uploading a file to an IBM Cloud Function takes some consideration. In this post we combine IBM Cloud Object Storage with Web Actions for robust storage.

- What I Install: I have been a Mac user for some time, and really committed to the platform with the release of Mac OS X. Here is what I installed, when I moved to Mojave.

- Transferable ImageData: When passed as a transferable object (versus structured clone), the reference to the place in memory where the object resides is being handed off.

- Image Processing in a Web Worker: Web Workers give us a separate thread but they come with a trade-off - no access to the DOM. In the case of image processing however, this does not matter.

- Teaching Watson to See My Garage: Svelte data binding is a joy, but you can work yourself into a corner if you are not careful. Take a closer look at some edge cases to stay on track.
