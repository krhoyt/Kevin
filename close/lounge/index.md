In this day of negative sentiment towards smoking you might be inclined to think that the cigar lounge would be a dying breed. As bars, restaurants, and public spaces alike ban smoking, brothers of the leaf (BOTL) find sanctuary in their local cigar lounge.

As a frequent traveler, I find myself in the position of getting to experience the character of these fine establishments all over the world. This then is my ode to the character, and characters, of the places I have encountered along the way.

### Boisdale of Canary Wharf
*15 Cabot Square, Canary Wharf, London E14 4QT, UK*
Last visited: July 2, 2017

There are several [Boisdale](https://www.boisdale.co.uk) locations around London, all of which are smoker friendly. The Canary Wharf location features a plush, enclosed, lounge where you can get high-end food, drink, and cigars. The Scottish decor begs a single malt pairing. An attendant will see to your every need along the way.

### Cigar Bar and Grill
*850 Montgomery St, San Francisco, CA 94133*
Last visited: April 24, 2018

![Cigars. Downtown. SF.](/img/lounge/cigar.bar.sf.jpg)

Cigar smoking, food, and liquor in downtown San Francisco, CA? You bet! Formally a restaurant with live music, salsa lessons, and more, attached to an open-air, heated, patio. The food is really good, if a little on the expenseive side. And the same could be said for the small humidor.

### Cigars at No. 10
*10 Manchester St, Marylebone, London W1U 4DG, UK*
Last visited: July 17, 2017

![High class. Or. Not.](/img/lounge/cigars.at.no.ten.jpg)

Technically a hotel, with an outstanding restaurant, there is a small-ish, but very comfortable outdoor smoking area (COSA) in the back. The area is heated, with a privacy screen for your pleasure. The staff is very attentive, and highly trained. They will escort you to their humidor, which is well-stocked with a large assortment of Cuban cigars. Just be prepared for the bespoke price tag.

### Havana Cigar Lounge
*4850 W Flamingo Rd #18, Las Vegas, NV 89103*
Last visited: February 21, 2018

![Dark. Plush. Classic.](/img/lounge/havana.cigar.vegas.jpg)

On a rare, rainy, late afternoon in Las Vegas, I slipped off the strip to Havana Cigar Lounge. The doors at the front and the back of the store were propped open. A cool breeze drifted through keeping the air fresh. The humidor was lightly stocked, but had a respectable variety. The host popped in a video showcasing James J. Fox in London - another lounge in this list.

### Havana Garage
*1008 Howard St, Omaha, NE 68102*
Last visited: September 6, 2018

![People watching on the Old Market.](/img/lounge/havana.garage.omaha.jpg)

The Old Market in downtown Omaha, Nebraska, is a trendy, night-life destination pretty much any day of the week. Nestled on the brick-lined main street, is Havana Garage, where you can have a cigar, choose from a wide variety of alcoholic beverages, and people watch the night away. Well stocked, if a little pricey, humidor in the basement.

### Habana House Cigar Lounge
*13729 Research Blvd #1075, Austin, TX 78750*
Last visited: August 26, 2019

![Walk right in, sit right down.](/img/lounge/habana.house.austin.jpg)

This lounge has three distinct seating areas, each with its own set of televisions. Pick your area - news, sports, history, fiction. The massive walk-in humidor will be sure to offer something to fit your palate. A variety of food options are within walking distance (even in the Austin summer). Spacious patio in the front.

### James J. Fox
*19 St James's St, St. James's, London SW1A 1ES, UK*
Last visited: August 26, 2017

![Sit in the same chair as Churchill himself.](/img/lounge/james.j.fox.jpg)

Do you like a churchill? Would you like to sit in the chair, in the lounge, where Winston Churchill would visit for a cigar? Welcome home! With a cigar museum, fantastic selection and service, and a spacious lounge, it is hard to beat the historic pleasure of [James J. Fox](https://www.jjfox.co.uk/).

### Maduros
*2997 Cumberland Blvd SE, Atlanta, GA 30339*
Last visited: March 6, 2019

![Get your funky drink on.](/img/lounge/maduros.jpg)

If you are catching a Braves game, or are in the Galleria area for a conference, and you want to grab a cigar, an adult beverage, and get your funk on, then you have come to the right spot. Part night club, part cigar lounge, [Maduros](https://maduroscigarshop.com) has a smallish humidor, but with enough variety for every stogie lover. And did I mention adult beverages?

### Orlando Cigar and Tobacco
*9924 Universal Blvd #218, Orlando, FL 32819*
Last visited: July 21, 2019

![Theme park getaway for the suburban dad.](/img/lounge/orlando.cigars.tobacco.jpg)

If you are in Orlando, FL, and looking for the quintessential cigar lounge - this is not it. If you are a suburban dad, booked in the VRBO at [Vista Cay](https://www.vistacayholidays.com) across the street, and looking for a little escape from theme park madness and kids - you have found your nirvana. Pick up a beverage at the Publix on the way in, or have some tea at the shop.

### Slo Burn
*10449 S Parker Rd, Parker, CO 80134*
Last visited: All the time

![The testosterone overfloweth.](/img/lounge/slo.burn.jpg)

Veteran owned and operated, I consider [Slo Burn](https://www.sloburncigars.com/) to be my "home" lounge. If you are ever on the south side of Denver, drop on by, and you will likely find me here. Public seating in the front, private lounge with stocked minibar in the back. Televisions and leather recliners all around. Sizable walk-in humidor with a wide selection.

### Smoking Cave
*5435 Boatworks Dr, Highlands Ranch, CO 80126*
Last visited: Every Thursday

![A cave with a mermaid view.](/img/lounge/smoking.cave.jpg)

Probably the most well-known cigar lounge in the Denver metro, where the humidor has a large selection and the best prices in town. The front of the store is open to the public and has a dozen or so leather seats for your smoking pleasure. The members lounge has another two-dozen leather seats. Special events abound, usually with free food. Just watch out that Quang does not steal your stick.

### Tobacco Leaf
*6870 S Rainbow Blvd #118, Las Vegas, NV 89118*
Last visited: February 22, 2018

![Lounge in the back.](/img/lounge/tobacco.leaf.4.jpg)

What?! You go to Las Vegas and you head to a shop off the strip? Yes. Yes I do. The tiled room in the back with a dozen or so leather chairs is a perfect escape from the constant barrage of casino noise. A lengthy, and well-categorized, humidor runs along the length of most of the store where you are sure to find a stick of your liking.
